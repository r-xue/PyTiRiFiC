	Volume = 850,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {Until recently, determining the rotational properties of galaxies in the early universe (z> 4, universe age < 1.5 Gyr) was impractical, with the exception of a few strongly lensed systems. Combining the high resolution and sensitivity of ALMA at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths with the typically high strength of the [C II] 158 mum emission line from galaxies and long-developed dynamical modeling tools raises the possibility of characterizing the gas dynamics in both extreme starburst galaxies and normal star-forming disk galaxies at z˜ 4{--}7. Using a procedure centered around GIPSY's ROTCUR task, we have fit tilted ring models to some of the best available ALMA [C II] data of a small set of galaxies: the MS galaxies HZ9 and HZ10, the damped Lyalpha absorber host galaxy ALMA J0817+1351, the submm galaxies AzTEC/C159 and COSMOS J1000+0234, and the quasar host galaxy ULAS J1319+0950. This procedure directly derives rotation curves and dynamical masses as functions of radius for each object. In one case, we present evidence for a dark matter halo of { O }({10}11) {M}&sun; . We present an analysis of the possible velocity dispersions of two sources based on matching simulated observations to the integrated [C II] line profiles. Finally, we test the effects of observation resolution and sensitivity on our results. While the conclusions remain limited at the resolution and signal-to-noise ratios of these observations, the results demonstrate the viability of the modeling tools at high redshift, and the exciting potential for detailed dynamical analysis of the earliest galaxies, as ALMA achieves full observational capabilities.},

	Volume = 861,
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We present morphological properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3 determined with the high-resolution (FWHM ˜ 0."19) Atacama Large Milllimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1 mm map of our ASAGAO survey covering a 26 arcmin2 area in GOODS-S. In conjunction with the ALMA archival data, our sample consists of 45 ALMA sources with infrared luminosity (L IR) range of ˜1011-1013 L &sun;. To obtain an average rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) profile, we perform individual measurements and careful stacking of the ALMA sources using the uv-visibility method that includes positional-uncertainty and smoothing-effect evaluations through Monte Carlo simulations. We find that our sample has an average FIR-wavelength S{\'e}rsic index and effective radius of n FIR = 1.2 $\pm$ 0.2 and R e,FIR = 1.0-1.3 kpc, respectively, additionally with a point-source component at the center, indicative of the existence of active galactic nuclei. The average FIR profile agrees with a morphology of an exponential disk clearly distinguished from a de Vaucouleurs spheroidal profile (S{\'e}rsic index of 4). We also examine the rest-frame optical S{\'e}rsic index n opt and effective radius R e,opt with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Interestingly, we obtain n opt = 0.9 $\pm$ 0.3 (~=n FIR) and R e,opt = 3.2 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc (>R e,FIR), suggesting that the dusty disk-like structure is embedded within a larger stellar disk. The rest-frame UV and FIR data of HST and ALMA provide us with a radial profile of the total star formation rate (SFR), where the infrared SFR dominates over the UV SFR at the center. Under the assumption of a constant SFR, a compact stellar distribution in z ˜ 1-2 compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs) is well reproduced, while a spheroidal stellar morphology of cQGs (n opt = 4) is not, suggestive of other important mechanism(s) such as dynamical dissipation.},

	Abstract = {We use Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of four submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at z ˜ 2-3 to investigate the spatially resolved properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at scales of 1-5 kpc (0."1-0."6). The velocity fields of our sources, traced by the 12CO(J = 3-2) emission, are consistent with disk rotation to the first order, implying average dynamical masses of ˜3 × 1011 {M}&sun;  within two half-light radii. Through a Bayesian approach we investigate the uncertainties inherent to dynamically constraining total gas masses. We explore the covariance between the stellar mass-to-light ratio and CO-to-H2 conversion factor, alpha CO, finding values of {alpha }CO={1.1}-0.7+0.8 for dark matter fractions of 15%. We show that the resolved spatial distribution of the gas and dust continuum can be uncorrelated to the stellar emission, challenging energy balance assumptions in global SED fitting. Through a stacking analysis of the resolved radial profiles of the CO(3-2), stellar, and dust continuum emission in SMG samples, we find that the cool molecular gas emission in these sources (radii ˜5-14 kpc) is clearly more extended than the rest-frame ˜250 mum dust continuum by a factor >2. We propose that assuming a constant dust-to-gas ratio, this apparent difference in sizes can be explained by temperature and optical depth gradients alone. Our results suggest that caution must be exercised when extrapolating morphological properties of dust continuum observations to conclusions about the molecular gas phase of the interstellar medium (ISM).},

	Abstract = {Enormous Lyalpha nebulae (ELANe) represent the extrema of Lyalpha nebulosities. They have detected extents of >200 kpc in Lyalpha and Lyalpha luminosities >1044 erg s-1. The ELAN population is an ideal laboratory to study the interactions between galaxies and the intergalactic/circumgalactic medium (IGM/CGM) given their brightness and sizes. The current sample size of ELANe is still very small, and the few z ≈ 2 ELANe discovered to date are all associated with local overdensities of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Inspired by these results, we have initiated a survey of ELANe associated with quasi-stellar object (QSO) pairs using the Palomar and Keck Cosmic Web Imagers (PCWI/KCWI). In this Letter, we present our first result: the discovery of ELAN0101+0201 associated with a QSO pair at z = 2.45. Our PCWI discovery data shows that, above a 2sigma surface brightness of 1.2 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2, the end-to-end size of ELAN0101+0201 is ≳232 kpc. We have conducted follow-up observations using KCWI, resolving multiple Lyalpha emitting sources within the rectangular field of view of ≈130 × 165 projected kpc2, and obtaining their emission line profiles at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns). Combining both KCWI and PCWI, our observations confirm that ELAN0101+0201 resides in an extremely overdense environment. Our observations further support that a large amount of cool (T ˜ 104 K) gas could exist in massive halos (M ≳1013 M &sun;) at z ≈ 2. Future observations on a larger sample of similar systems will provide statistics of how cool gas is distributed in massive overdensities at high redshift and strongly constrain the evolution of the intracluster medium.},

	Volume = 525,

	Abstract = {Submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshift are the most luminous, heavily star-forming galaxies in the Universe and are characterized by prodigious emission in the far-infrared, with a flux of at least five millijanskys at a wavelength of 850 micrometres. They reside in haloes with masses about 1013 times that of the Sun, have low gas fractions compared to main-sequence disks at a comparable redshift, trace complex environments and are not easily observable at optical wavelengths. Their physical origin remains unclear. Simulations have been able to form galaxies with the requisite luminosities, but have otherwise been unable to simultaneously match the stellar masses, star formation rates, gas fractions and environments. Here we report a cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation that is able to form a submillimetre galaxy that simultaneously satisfies the broad range of observed physical constraints. We find that groups of galaxies residing in massive dark matter haloes have increasing rates of star formation that peak at collective rates of about 500-1,000 solar masses per year at redshifts of two to three, by which time the interstellar medium is sufficiently enriched with metals that the region may be observed as a submillimetre-selected system. The intense star formation rates are fuelled in part by the infall of a reservoir gas supply enabled by stellar feedback at earlier times, not through major mergers. With a lifetime of nearly a billion years, our simulations show that the submillimetre-bright phase of high-redshift galaxies is prolonged and associated with significant mass buildup in early-Universe proto-clusters, and that many submillimetre-bright galaxies are composed of numerous unresolved components (for which there is some observational evidence).},

We detect line emission from CO J = 7 --> 6, [C I] 3 P 2 --> 3 P 1, and p-H2O 211 --> 202 and continuum emission at 230 GHz. At a spatial resolution of 0."2 and a spectral resolution of 40 km s-1, the source is resolved into three distinct components, which are spatially and dynamically associated within a projected radius of 20 kpc and a radial velocity range of 2000 km s-1. For two major components, our Bayesian-based tilted-ring modeling of the ALMA spectral cubes shows almost flat rotation curves peaking at ~500 km s-1 at galactocentric distances between 2 and 5 kpc. Each of them has a dynamical mass of ~1011 M &sun;. The combination of the dynamical masses and the archival CO J = 1 --> 0 data places strong upper limits on the CO --> H2 conversion factor of alpha CO ≲ 1.4--2.0 M &sun;(K km s-1 pc2)-1. These limits are significantly below the Galactic inner disk alpha CO value of 4.3 M &sun;(K km s-1 pc2)-1 but are consistent with those of local starbursts. Therefore, the previously estimated short gas depletion timescale of ~200 Myr remains unchanged.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We wish to separate and quantify the CO luminosity and CO-H2 conversion factor applicable to diffuse but partially-molecular ISM when H2 and CO are present but C+ is the dominant form of gas-phase carbon.  Methods: We discuss galactic lines of sight observed in Hi, HCO+ and CO where CO emission is present but the intervening clouds are diffuse (locally AV ≲ 1 mag) with relatively small CO column densities NCO ≲ 2 × 1016 cm-2. We separate the atomic and molecular fractions statistically using EB-V as a gauge of the total gas column density and compare N_H_2 to the observed CO brightness.  Results: Although there are H2-bearing regions where CO emission is too faint to be detected, the mean ratio of integrated CO brightness to N_H_2 for diffuse ISM does not differ from the usual value of 1K km s-1 of integrated CO brightness per 2 × 1020 H2 cm-2. Moreover, the luminosity of diffuse CO viewed perpendicular to the galactic plane is 2/3 that seen at the Solar galactic radius in surveys of CO emission near the galactic plane.  Conclusions: Commonality of the CO-H2 conversion factors in diffuse and dark clouds can be understood from considerations of radiative transfer and CO chemistry. There is unavoidable confusion between CO emission from diffuse and dark gas and misattribution of CO emission from diffuse to dark or giant molecular clouds. The character of the ISM is different from what has been believed if CO and H2 that have been attributed to molecular clouds on the verge of star formation are actually in more tenuous, gravitationally-unbound diffuse gas.

	Title = {{COLDz: Shape of the CO Luminosity Function at High Redshift and the Cold Gas History of the Universe}},
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We report the first detailed measurement of the shape of the CO luminosity function at high redshift, based on $>$320 hr of Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations taken as part of the CO Luminosity Density at High Redshift (COLDz) survey. COLDz "blindly" selects galaxies based on their cold gas content through CO($J$=1$\to$0) emission at $z$$\sim$2-3 and CO($J$=2$\to$1) at $z$$\sim$5-7. We find that the characteristic luminosity and bright end of the CO luminosity function are substantially higher than predicted by semi-analytical models, but consistent with empirical estimates based on the infrared luminosity function at $z$$\sim$2. We also present the currently most reliable measurement of the cosmic density of cold gas in galaxies at early epochs, i.e., the cold gas history of the universe, as determined over a large cosmic volume of $\sim$375,000 Mpc$^3$. Our measurements are in agreement with an increase of the cold gas density from $z$$\sim$0 to $z$$\sim$2-3, followed by a possible decline towards $z$$\sim$5-7. These findings are consistent with recent surveys based on higher-$J$ CO line measurements, upon which COLDz improves in terms of statistical uncertainties by probing $\sim$50-100 times larger areas and in the reliability of total gas mass estimates by probing the low-$J$ CO lines accessible to the VLA. Our results thus appear to suggest that the cosmic star-formation rate density follows an increased cold molecular gas content in galaxies towards its peak about 10 billion years ago, and that its decline towards the earliest epochs is likely related to a lower overall amount of cold molecular gas (as traced by CO) bound in galaxies towards the first billion years after the Big Bang.},

	Title = {{Molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous galaxies at z $\gt$ 1}},
	Volume = 415,
	Year = 2011,
	Abstract = {We present interferometric CO observations of 12 z˜ 2 submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (SFRGs) which are thought to be ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) possibly dominated by warmer dust (Tdust ≳ 40 K) than submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) of similar luminosities. Four other CO-observed SFRGs are included from the literature, and all the observations are taken at the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) in the compact configuration. 10 of the 16 SFRGs observed in CO (63 per cent) are detected at >4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ˜2 × 1010 M&sun;. SFRGs trend slightly above the local ULIRG LFIR-L'CO relation. Since SFRGs are about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar CO luminosities to SMGs, this suggests SFRGs are slightly more efficient star formers than SMGs at the same redshifts. SFRGs also have a narrow mean CO linewidth, 320 $\pm$ 80 km s-1. Many SMGs have similarly narrow CO linewidths, but very broad features (˜900 km s-1) are present in a few SMGs and are absent from SFRGs. SFRGs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous >5 × 1012 L&sun; SMGs and those of local ULIRGs, and are consistent with intermediate-stage major mergers. We suspect that more moderate luminosity SMGs, not yet surveyed in CO, would show similar molecular gas properties to SFRGs. The active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction of SFRGs is consistent with SMGs and is estimated to be 0.3 $\pm$ 0.1, suggesting that SFRGs are observed near the peak phase of star formation activity and not in a later, post-SMG enhanced AGN phase. The excitation analysis of one SFRG is consistent with the CO excitation observed in SMGs [turning over beyond 12CO(J= 4-->3)]. This CO survey of SFRGs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey of Herschel and SCUBA-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with SMGs. Better constraints on the CO properties of a diverse high-z ULIRG population are needed from ALMA to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts, and what role ULIRGs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellar systems in the early Universe.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the CO excitation of normal (near-IR selected BzK) star-forming (SF) disk galaxies at z = 1.5 using IRAM Plateau de Bure observations of the CO[2-1], CO[3-2], and CO[5-4] transitions for four galaxies, including VLA observations of CO[1-0] for three of them, with the aim of constraining the average state of H2 gas. By exploiting previous knowledge of the velocity range, spatial extent, and size of the CO emission, we measure reliable line fluxes with a signal-to-noise ratio >4-7 for individual transitions. While the average CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) has a subthermal excitation similar to the Milky Way (MW) up to CO[3-2], we show that the average CO[5-4] emission is four times stronger than assuming MW excitation. This demonstrates that there is an additional component of more excited, denser, and possibly warmer molecular gas. The ratio of CO[5-4] to lower-J CO emission is lower than in local (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and high-redshift starbursting submillimeter galaxies, however, and appears to be closely correlated with the average intensity of the radiation field < U > and with the star formation surface density, but not with the star formation efficiency. The luminosity of the CO[5-4] transition is found to be linearly correlated with the bolometric infrared luminosity over four orders of magnitudes. For this transition, z = 1.5 BzK galaxies follow the same linear trend as local spirals and (U)LIRGs and high-redshift star-bursting submillimeter galaxies. The CO[5-4] luminosity is thus empirically related to the dense gas and might be a more convenient way to probe it than standard high-density tracers that are much fainter than CO. We see excitation variations among our sample galaxies that can be linked to their evolutionary state and clumpiness in optical rest-frame images. In one galaxy we see spatially resolved excitation variations, where the more highly excited part of the galaxy corresponds to the location of massive SF clumps. This provides support to models that suggest that giant clumps are the main source of the high-excitation CO emission in high-redshift disk-like galaxies.},

	Volume = 713,
	Year = 2010,
	Abstract = {We present evidence for very high gas fractions and extended molecular gas reservoirs in normal, near-infrared-selected (BzK) galaxies at z ~ 1.5. Our results are based on multi-configuration CO[2-1] observations obtained at the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. All six star-forming galaxies observed were detected at high significance. High spatial resolution observations resolve the CO emission in four of them, implying sizes of the gas reservoirs of order of 6-11 kpc and suggesting the presence of ordered rotation. The galaxies have UV morphologies consistent with clumpy, unstable disks, and UV sizes that are consistent with those measured in CO. The star formation efficiencies are homogeneously low within the sample and similar to those of local spirals---the resulting gas depletion times are ~0.5 Gyr, much higher than what is seen in high-z submillimeter galaxies and quasars. The CO luminosities can be predicted to within 0.15 dex from the observed star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying a tight correlation of the gas mass with these quantities. We use new dynamical models of clumpy disk galaxies to derive dynamical masses for our sample. These models are able to reproduce the peculiar spectral line shapes of the CO emission. After accounting for the stellar and dark matter masses, we derive molecular gas reservoirs with masses of (0.4-1.2)×1011 M sun. The implied conversion (CO luminosity-to-gas mass) factor is very high: alphaCO = 3.6 $\pm$ 0.8, consistent with a Galactic conversion factor but 4 times higher than that of local ultra-luminous IR galaxies that is typically used for high-redshift objects. The gas mass in these galaxies is comparable to or larger than the stellar mass, and the gas accounts for an impressive 50%-65% of the baryons within the galaxies' half-light radii. We are thus witnessing truly gas-dominated galaxies at z ~ 1.5, a finding that explains the high specific SFRs observed for z > 1 galaxies. The BzK galaxies can be viewed as scaled-up versions of local disk galaxies, with low-efficiency star formation taking place inside extended, low-excitation gas disks. These galaxies are markedly different than local ULIRGs and high-z submillimeter galaxies and quasars, where higher excitation and more compact gas is found.},

	Title = {{A Herschel [C ii] Galactic plane survey. II. CO-dark H$_{2}$ in clouds}},
	Volume = 561,
	Year = 2014,
	Abstract = {Context. H i and CO large scale surveys of the Milky Way trace the diffuse atomic clouds and the dense shielded regions of molecular hydrogen clouds, respectively. However, until recently, we have not had spectrally resolved C+ surveys in sufficient lines of sight to characterize the ionized and photon dominated components of the interstellar medium, in particular, the H2 gas without CO, referred to as CO-dark H2, in a large sample of interstellar clouds.  Aims: We use a sparse Galactic plane survey of the 1.9 THz (158 mum) [C ii] spectral line from the Herschel open time key programme, Galactic Observations of Terahertz C+ (GOT C+), to characterize the H2 gas without CO in a statistically significant sample of interstellar clouds.  Methods: We identify individual clouds in the inner Galaxy by fitting the [C ii] and CO isotopologue spectra along each line of sight. We then combine these spectra with those of H i and use them along with excitation models and cloud models of C+ to determine the column densities and fractional mass of CO-dark H2 clouds.  Results: We identify1804 narrow velocity [C ii] components corresponding to interstellar clouds in different categories and evolutionary states. About 840 are diffuse molecular clouds with no CO, ~510 are transition clouds containing [C ii] and 12CO, but no 13CO, and the remainder are dense molecular clouds containing 13CO emission. The CO-dark H2 clouds are concentrated between Galactic radii of ~3.5 to 7.5 kpc and the column density of the CO-dark H2 layer varies significantly from cloud to cloud with a global average of 9 × 1020 cm-2. These clouds contain a significant fraction by mass of CO-dark H2, that varies from ~75% for diffuse molecular clouds to ~20% for dense molecular clouds.  Conclusions: We find a significant fraction of the warm molecular ISM gas is invisible in H i and CO, but is detected in [C ii]. The fraction of CO-dark H2 is greatest in the diffuse clouds and decreases with increasing total column density, and is lowest in the massive clouds. The column densities and mass fraction of CO-dark H2 are less than predicted by models of diffuse molecular clouds using solar metallicity, which is not surprising as most of our detections are in Galactic regions where the metallicity is larger and shielding more effective. There is an overall trend towards a higher fraction of CO-dark H2 in clouds with increasing Galactic radius, consistent with lower metallicity there.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	Volume = 864,
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We describe the CO Luminosity Density at High-z (COLDz) survey, the first spectral line deep field targeting CO(1--0) emission from galaxies at z = 1.95--2.85 and CO(2--1) at z = 4.91--6.70. The main goal of COLDz is to constrain the cosmic density of molecular gas at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. By targeting both a wide (~51 arcmin2) and a deep (~9 arcmin2) area, the survey is designed to robustly constrain the bright end and the characteristic luminosity of the CO(1--0) luminosity function. An extensive analysis of the reliability of our line candidates and new techniques provide detailed completeness and statistical corrections as necessary to determine the best constraints to date on the CO luminosity function. Our blind search for CO(1--0) uniformly selects starbursts and massive main-sequence galaxies based on their cold molecular gas masses. Our search also detects CO(2--1) line emission from optically dark, dusty star-forming galaxies at z > 5. We find a range of spatial sizes for the CO-traced gas reservoirs up to ~40 kpc, suggesting that spatially extended cold molecular gas reservoirs may be common in massive, gas-rich galaxies at z ~ 2. Through CO line stacking, we constrain the gas mass fraction in previously known typical star-forming galaxies at z = 2--3. The stacked CO detection suggests lower molecular gas mass fractions than expected for massive main-sequence galaxies by a factor of ~3--6. We find total CO line brightness at ~34 GHz of 0.45 $\pm$ 0.2 muK, which constrains future line intensity mapping and CMB experiments.},

	Title = {{COLDz: Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Discovery of a Gas-rich Galaxy in COSMOS}},
	Volume = 800,
	Year = 2015,
	Abstract = {The broad spectral bandwidth at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths provided by the recent upgrades to the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) has made it possible to conduct unbiased searches for molecular CO line emission at redshifts, z > 1.31. We present the discovery of a gas-rich, star-forming galaxy at z = 2.48 through the detection of CO J = 1-0 line emission in the COLDz survey and through a sensitive, Ka-band (31-39 GHz) VLA survey of a 6.5 arcmin2 region of the COSMOS field. We argue that the broad line (FWHM ~ 570 $\pm$ 80 km s-1) is most likely to be CO J = 1-0 at z = 2.48, as the integrated emission is spatially coincident with an infrared-detected galaxy with a photometric redshift estimate of z phot = 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4. The CO J = 1-0 line luminosity is L\prime _CO = (2.2+/- 0.3) × 1010 K km s-1 pc2, suggesting a cold molecular gas mass of M gas ~ (2-8) × 1010 M &sun; depending on the assumed value of the molecular gas mass to CO luminosity ratio alphaCO. The estimated infrared luminosity from the (rest-frame) far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) is L IR = 2.5 × 1012 L &sun; and the star formation rate is ~250 M &sun; yr-1, with the SED shape indicating substantial dust obscuration of the stellar light. The infrared to CO line luminosity ratio is ~114 $\pm$ 19 L &sun;/(K km s-1 pc2), similar to galaxies with similar SFRs selected at UV/optical to radio wavelengths. This discovery confirms the potential for molecular emission line surveys as a route to study populations of gas-rich galaxies in the future.},

	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measurements of the ``Cosmic Seagull,'' a strongly magnified galaxy at z = 2.7779 behind the Bullet Cluster. We report CO(3-2) and continuum 344 mum (rest-frame) data at one of the highest differential magnifications ever recorded at submillimeter wavelengths (mu up to ˜50), facilitating a characterization of the kinematics of a rotational curve in great detail (at ˜620 pc resolution in the source plane). We find no evidence for a decreasing rotation curve, from which we derive a dynamical mass of  (6.3 $\pm$ 0.7) × 1010 M &sun; within r = 2.6 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc.  The discovery of a third, unpredicted, image  provides key information for a future improvement of the lensing modeling of the Bullet Cluster and allows a measure of the stellar mass,  1.6 -0.86+1.9×  10 10  M &sun; , unaffected by strong differential magnification. The baryonic mass is expected to be dominated by the molecular gas content (f gas <= 80 $\pm$ 20%) based on an  M    H  2  mass estimated from the difference between dynamical and stellar masses. The star formation rate (SFR) is estimated via the spectral energy distribution (SFR = 190 $\pm$ 10 M &sun; yr-1), implying a molecular gas depletion time of 0.25 $\pm$ 0.08 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {Galactic rotation curves exhibit diverse behavior in the inner regions, while obeying an organizing principle, i.e., they can be approximately described by a radial acceleration relation or the Modified Newtonian Dynamics phenomenology. We analyze the rotation curve data from the SPARC sample, and explicitly demonstrate that both the diversity and uniformity are naturally reproduced in a hierarchical structure formation model with the addition of dark matter self-interactions. The required concentrations of the dark matter halos are fully consistent with the concentration-mass relation predicted by the Planck cosmological model. The inferred stellar mass-to-light ($3.6 \mu m$) ratios scatter around $0.5 M_\odot/L_\odot$, as expected from population synthesis models, leading to a tight radial acceleration relation and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. The inferred stellar-halo mass relation is consistent with the expectations from abundance matching. These results indicate that the inner dark matter halos of galaxies are thermalized due to the self-interactions of dark matter particles.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies of galaxies ~2-3Gyr after the Big Bang have revealed large, rotating disks, similar to those of galaxies today. The existence of well-ordered rotation in galaxies during this peak epoch of cosmic star formation indicates that gas accretion is likely to be the dominant mode by which galaxies grow, because major mergers of galaxies would completely disrupt the observed velocity fields. But poor spatial resolution and sensitivity have hampered this interpretation; such studies have been limited to the largest and most luminous galaxies, which may have fundamentally different modes of assembly from those of more typical galaxies (which are thought to grow into the spheroidal components at the centres of galaxies similar to the Milky Way). Here we report observations of a typical star-forming galaxy at z = 3.07, with a linear resolution of ~100parsecs. We find a well-ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being converted efficiently into stars, likely to be assembling a spheroidal bulge similar to those seen in spiral galaxies at the present day. The presence of undisrupted rotation may indicate that galaxies such as the Milky Way gain much of their mass by accretion rather than major mergers.},

	Volume = 753,
	Year = 2012,
	Abstract = {We have used high-resolution (~2farcs3) observations of the local (D L = 46 Mpc) luminous infrared galaxy Arp 299 to map out the physical properties of the molecular gas that provides the fuel for its extreme star formation activity. The 12CO J = 3-2, 12CO J = 2-1, and 13CO J = 2-1 lines were observed with the Submillimeter Array, and the short spacings of the 12CO J = 2-1 and J = 3-2 observations have been recovered using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope single dish observations. We use the radiative transfer code RADEX to estimate the physical properties (density, column density, and temperature) of the different regions in this system. The RADEX solutions of the two galaxy nuclei, IC 694 and NGC 3690, are consistent with a wide range of gas components, from warm moderately dense gas with T kin > 30 K and n(H2) ~ 0.3-3 × 103 cm-3 to cold dense gas with T kin ~ 10-30 K and n(H2) > 3 × 103 cm-3. The overlap region is shown to have a better constrained solution with T kin ~ 10-50 K and n(H2) ~ 1-30 × 103 cm-3. We estimate the gas masses and star formation rates of each region in order to derive molecular gas depletion times. The depletion times of all regions (20-50 Myr) are found to be about two orders of magnitude lower than those of normal spiral galaxies. This rapid depletion time can probably be explained by a high fraction of dense gas on kiloparsec scales in Arp 299. We estimate the CO-to-H2 factor, alphaco to be 0.4 $\pm$ 0.3(3 × 10-4/x CO) M&sun; (K km s-1 pc2)-1 for the overlap region. This value agrees well with values determined previously for more advanced merger systems.},

	Volume = 827,

	Abstract = {We use the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves database to study the relation between the central surface density of stars    Sigma    \star (0) and dynamical mass    Sigma      dyn  (0) in 135 disk galaxies (S0 to dIrr). We find that    Sigma      dyn  (0) correlates tightly with    Sigma    \star (0) over 4 dex. This central density relation can be described by a double power law. High surface brightness galaxies are consistent with a 1:1 relation, suggesting that they are self-gravitating and baryon dominated in the inner parts. Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies systematically deviate from the 1:1 line, indicating that the dark matter contribution progressively increases but remains tightly coupled to the stellar one. The observed scatter is small (˜0.2 dex) and largely driven by observational uncertainties. The residuals show no correlations with other galaxy properties like stellar mass, size, or gas fraction.},

	Year = 2016,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the shape of the innermost part of the rotation curves of a sample of 29 nearby spiral galaxies, based on high angular and spectral resolution kinematic Halpha Fabry-Perot observations. In particular, we quantify the steepness of the rotation curve by measuring its slope dRvc(0). We explore the relationship between the inner slope and several galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass, maximum rotational velocity, central surface brightness (mu0), bar strength and bulge-to-total ratio. Even with our limited dynamical range, we find a trend for low-mass galaxies to exhibit shallower rotation curve inner slopes than high-mass galaxies, whereas steep inner slopes are found exclusively in high-mass galaxies. This trend may arise from the relationship between the total stellar mass and the mass of the bulge, which are correlated among them. We find a correlation between the inner slope of the rotation curve and the morphological T-type, complementary to the scaling relation between dRvc(0) and mu0 previously reported in the literature. Although we find that the inner slope increases with the Fourier amplitude A2 and decreases with the bar torque Qb, this may arise from the presence of the bulge implicit in both A2 and Qb. As previously noted in the literature, the more compact the mass in the central parts of a galaxy (more concretely, the presence of a bulge), the steeper the inner slopes. We conclude that the baryonic matter dominates the dynamics in the central parts of our sample galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present rotation curves of 19 galaxies from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). The high spatial and velocity resolution of THINGS make these the highest quality H I rotation curves available to date for a large sample of nearby galaxies, spanning a wide range of H I masses and luminosities. The high quality of the data allows us to derive the geometric and dynamical parameters using H I data alone. We do not find any declining rotation curves unambiguously associated with a cut-off in the mass distribution out to the last measured point. The rotation curves are combined with 3.6 mum data from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey to construct mass models. Our best-fit dynamical disk masses, derived from the rotation curves, are in good agreement with photometric disk masses derived from the 3.6 mum images in combination with stellar population synthesis arguments and two different assumptions for the stellar initial mass function (IMF). We test the cold dark matter (CDM) motivated cusp model, and the observationally motivated central density core model and find that (independent of IMF) for massive, disk-dominated galaxies, all halo models fit apparently equally well; for low-mass galaxies, however, a core-dominated halo is clearly preferred over a cusp-like halo. The empirically derived densities of the dark matter halos of the late-type galaxies in our sample are half of what is predicted by CDM simulations, again independent of the assumed IMF.},

	Title = {{Evidence of a Flat Outer Rotation Curve in a Starbursting Disk Galaxy at $z=1.6$}},
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {Observations of the baryon to dark matter fraction in galaxies through cosmic time are a fundamental test for galaxy formation models. Recent observational studies have suggested that some disk galaxies at $z>1$ host declining rotation curves, in contrast with observations of low redshift disk galaxies where stellar or HI rotation curves flatten at large radii. We present an observational counterexample, a galaxy named DSFG850.95 at $z=1.555$ (4.1 Gyr after the big bang) that hosts a flat rotation curve between radii of $\sim$6--14 kpc (1.2--2.8 disk scale lengths) and has a dark matter fraction of $0.44\pm0.08$ at the H-band half light radius, similar to the Milky Way. We create position-velocity and position-dispersion diagrams using Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic observations of H$\alpha$ and [NII] emission features, which reveal a flat rotation velocity of $V_ \rm flat =285\pm12$ km/s and an ionized gas velocity dispersion of $\sigma_ 0 =48\pm4$ km/s. This galaxy has a rotation-dominated velocity field with $V_ \rm flat /\sigma_ 0 \sim6$. Ground-based H-band imaging reveals a disk with S\'ersic index of $1.29\pm0.03$, an edge-on inclination angle of $87\pm2^ \circ $, and an H-band half light radius of $8.4\pm0.1$ kpc. Our results point to DSFG850.95 being a massive, rotationally-supported disk galaxy with a high dark-matter-to-baryon fraction in the outer galaxy, similar to disk galaxies at low redshift.},

	Volume = 840,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {We exploit the deep, resolved, Halpha kinematic data from the KMOS3D and SINS/zC-SINF surveys to examine the largely unexplored outer-disk kinematics of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), out to the peak of cosmic star formation. Our sample contains 101 SFGs, representative of the more massive (9.3≲  log  M * / M &sun; ≲ 11.5) main sequence population at 0.6 <= z <= 2.6. Through a novel stacking approach, we are able to constrain a representative rotation curve extending out to ˜4 effective radii. This average rotation curve exhibits a significant drop in rotation velocity beyond the turnover, with a slope of   Delta   V/  Delta   R=- 0.26 -0.09+0.10 in units of normalized coordinates V/V max and R/R turn. This result confirms that the fall-off seen in some individual galaxies is a common feature of our sample of high-z disks. The outer fall-off strikingly deviates from the flat or mildly rising rotation curves of local spiral galaxies that have similar masses. Through a comparison with models that include baryons and dark matter, we demonstrate that the falling stacked rotation curve is consistent with a high mass fraction of baryons, relative to the total dark matter halo (m d ≳ 0.05), in combination with a sizeable level of pressure support in the outer disk. These findings agree with recent studies demonstrating that high-z star-forming disks are strongly baryon-dominated within the disk scale, and furthermore suggest that pressure gradients caused by large, turbulent gas motions are present even in their outer disks. These results are largely independent of our model assumptions, such as the presence of stellar bulges, the effect of adiabatic contraction, and variations in halo concentration.},

	Abstract = {We present a cross-calibration of CO- and dust-based molecular gas masses at z <= 0.2. Our results are based on a survey with the IRAM 30-m telescope collecting CO(1-0) measurements of 78 massive (logM*/M&sun;> 10) galaxies with known gas-phase metallicities and with IR photometric coverage from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer(WISE; 22 mum) and Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE; 250, 350, 500mum). We find a tight relation (˜0.17 dex scatter) between the gas masses inferred from CO and dust continuum emission, with a minor systematic offset of 0.05 dex. The two methods can be brought into agreement by applying a metallicity-dependent adjustment factor (˜0.13 dex scatter). We illustrate that the observed offset is consistent with a scenario in which dust traces not only molecular gas but also part of the HI reservoir, residing in the H2-dominated region of the galaxy. Observations of the CO(2-1) to CO(1-0) line ratio for two-thirds of the sample indicate a narrow range in excitation properties, with a median ratio of luminosities 21> ˜ 0.64. Finally, we find dynamical mass constraints from spectral line profile fitting to agree well with the anticipated mass budget enclosed within an effective radius, once all mass components (stars, gas, and dark matter) are accounted for.},

	Volume = 477,

	Abstract = {Deriving circular velocities of galaxies from stellar kinematics can provide an estimate of their total dynamical mass, provided a contribution from the velocity dispersion of the stars is taken into account. Molecular gas (e.g. CO), on the other hand, is a dynamically cold tracer and hence acts as an independent circular velocity estimate without needing such a correction. In this paper, we test the underlying assumptions of three commonly used dynamical models, deriving circular velocities from stellar kinematics of 54 galaxies (S0-Sd) that have observations of both stellar kinematics from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, and CO kinematics from the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (EDGE) survey. We test the asymmetric drift correction (ADC) method, as well as Jeans, and Schwarzschild models. The three methods each reproduce the CO circular velocity at 1Re to within 10 per cent. All three methods show larger scatter (up to 20 per cent) in the inner regions (R < 0.4Re) that may be due to an increasingly spherical mass distribution (which is not captured by the thin disc assumption in ADC), or non-constant stellar M/L ratios (for both the JAM and Schwarzschild models). This homogeneous analysis of stellar and gaseous kinematics validates that all three models can recover Mdyn at 1Re to better than 20 per cent, but users should be mindful of scatter in the inner regions where some assumptions may break down.},

	Abstract = {We present a comparative study of molecular and ionized gas kinematics in nearby galaxies. These results are based on observations from the EDGE survey, which measured spatially resolved 12CO(J = 1-0) in 126 nearby galaxies. Every galaxy in EDGE has corresponding resolved ionized gas measurements from CALIFA. Using a sub-sample of 17 rotation-dominated, star-forming galaxies where precise molecular gas rotation curves could be extracted, we derive CO and Halpha rotation curves using the same geometric parameters out to ≳1 R  e . We find that ˜75% of our sample galaxies have smaller ionized gas rotation velocities than the molecular gas in the outer part of the rotation curve. In no case is the molecular gas rotation velocity measurably lower than that of the ionized gas. We suggest that the lower ionized gas rotation velocity can be attributed to a significant contribution from extraplanar diffuse ionized gas in a thick, turbulence-supported disk. Using observations of the Hgamma transition, also available from CALIFA, we measure ionized gas velocity dispersions and find that these galaxies have sufficiently large velocity dispersions to support a thick ionized gas disk. Kinematic simulations show that a thick disk with a vertical rotation velocity gradient can reproduce the observed differences between the CO and Halpha rotation velocities. Observed line ratios tracing diffuse ionized gas are elevated compared to typical values in the midplane of the Milky Way. In galaxies affected by this phenomenon, dynamical masses measured using ionized gas rotation curves will be systematically underestimated.},

	Abstract = {The structure of a sample of high-redshift (z ~ 2), rotating galaxies with high star formation rates and turbulent gas velocities of sigma ≈ 40-80 km s-1 is investigated. Fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with a Mo et al. (MMW) model requires unusually large disk spin parameters lambda d >0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fractions of m  d  ≈ 0.2, close to the cosmic baryon fraction. The galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with 1 <= v max/sigma <= 3, maximum rotational velocities v max<= 200 km s-1, and disk half-light radii r 1/2≈ 1-3 kpc, and rotation-dominated systems with v max> 200 km s-1, v max/sigma>3, and r 1/2≈ 4-8 kpc. For the dispersion-dominated sample, radial pressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing the rotational velocities. Including this pressure effect in the MMW model, dispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters of lambda d  = 0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m  d  ≈ 0.2 and with lambda d  = 0.01-0.03 for m  d  ≈ 0.05. These values are in good agreement with cosmological expectations. For the rotation-dominated sample, however, pressure effects are small and better agreement with theoretically expected disk spin parameters can only be achieved if the dark halo mass contribution in the visible disk regime (2-3 × r 1/2) is smaller than predicted by the MMW model. We argue that these galaxies can still be embedded in standard cold dark matter halos if the halos do not contract adiabatically in response to disk formation. In this case, the data favor models with small disk mass fractions of m  d  = 0.05 and disk spin parameters of lambda d  ≈ 0.035. It is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of the galaxies are consistent with a Toomre instability parameter Q = 1 which is equal to the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be the major driver of turbulence. The dominant energy source of turbulence is then the potential energy of the gas in the disk.},

	Abstract = {The well-known Bayes theorem assumes that a posterior distribution is a probability distribution. However, the posterior distribution may no longer be a probability distribution if an improper prior distribution (non-probability measure) such as an unbounded uniform prior is used. Improper priors are often used in the astronomical literature to reflect a lack of prior knowledge, but checking whether the resulting posterior is a probability distribution is sometimes neglected. It turns out that s23 articles out of 75 articles (30.7%) published online in two renowned astronomy journals (ApJ and MNRAS) between Jan 1, 2017 and Oct 15, 2017 make use of Bayesian analyses without rigorously establishing posterior propriety. A disturbing aspect is that a Gibbs-type Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method can produce a seemingly reasonable posterior sample even when the posterior is not a probability distribution (Hobert and Casella 1996). In such cases, researchers may erroneously make probabilistic inferences without noticing that the MCMC sample is from a non-existing probability distribution. We review why checking posterior propriety is fundamental in Bayesian analyses, and discuss how to set up scientifically motivated proper priors.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we use ASPECS, the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field in band 3 and band 6, to place blind constraints on the CO luminosity function and the evolution of the cosmic molecular gas density as a function of redshift up to z ˜ 4.5. This study is based on galaxies that have been selected solely through their CO emission and not through any other property. In all of the redshift bins the ASPECS measurements reach the predicted ``knee'' of the CO luminosity function (around 5 × 109 K km s-1 pc2). We find clear evidence of an evolution in the CO luminosity function with respect to z ˜ 0, with more CO-luminous galaxies present at z ˜ 2. The observed galaxies at z ˜ 2 also appear more gas-rich than predicted by recent semi-analytical models. The comoving cosmic molecular gas density within galaxies as a function of redshift shows a drop by a factor of 3-10 from z ˜ 2 to z ˜ 0 (with significant error bars), and possibly a decline at z > 3. This trend is similar to the observed evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density. The latter therefore appears to be at least partly driven by the increased availability of molecular gas reservoirs at the peak of cosmic star formation (z ˜ 2).},

	Abstract = {We study the molecular gas properties of high-z galaxies observed in the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey (ASPECS) that targets an ˜1 arcmin2 region in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), a blind survey of CO emission (tracing molecular gas) in the 3 and 1 mm bands. Of a total of 1302 galaxies in the field, 56 have spectroscopic redshifts and correspondingly well-defined physical properties. Among these, 11 have infrared luminosities  L  IR \gt  10 11  L &sun; , I.e., a detection in CO emission was expected. Out of these, 7 are detected at various significance in CO, and 4 are undetected in CO emission. In the CO-detected sources, we find CO excitation conditions that are lower than those typically found in starburst/sub-mm galaxy/QSO environments. We use the CO luminosities (including limits for non-detections) to derive molecular gas masses. We discuss our findings in the context of previous molecular gas observations at high redshift (star formation law, gas depletion times, gas fractions): the CO-detected galaxies in the UDF tend to reside on the low- L  IR  envelope of the scatter in the  L  IR  --  L  CO \prime  relation, but exceptions exist. For the CO-detected sources, we find an average depletion time of ˜1 Gyr, with significant scatter. The average molecular-to-stellar mass ratio ( M   H 2 /M *) is consistent with earlier measurements of main-sequence galaxies at these redshifts, and again shows large variations among sources. In some cases, we also measure dust continuum emission. On average, the dust-based estimates of the molecular gas are a factor ˜2-5× smaller than those based on CO. When we account for detections as well as non-detections, we find large diversity in the molecular gas properties of the high-redshift galaxies covered by ASPECS.},

This procedure has revealed two components: a bright arm of molecular clouds containing approximately one-third of the emission, and a more uniform component which encompasses about two-thirds of the total emission inside R = 3 kpc. The arm deduced from this analysis has a spatial extent similar to that of the bright optical arms and a region of extended 10-100 micron emission, suggesting that the extended high luminosity component is energized by a burst of star formation.},

	Abstract = {Context. Atomic carbon can be an efficient tracer of the molecular gas mass, and when combined to the detection of high-J and low-J CO lines it yields also a sensitive probe of the power sources in the molecular gas of high-redshift galaxies.  Aims: The recently installed SEPIA 5 receiver at the focus of the APEX telescope has opened up a new window at frequencies 159-211 GHz allowing the exploration of the atomic carbon in high-z galaxies, at previously inaccessible frequencies from the ground. We have targeted three gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshift of about 3 and conducted a comparative study of the observed high-J CO/CI ratios with well-studied nearby galaxies.  Methods: Atomic carbon (CI(2-1)) was detected in one of the three targets and marginally in a second, while in all three targets the J = 7-->6 CO line is detected.  Results: The CO(7-6)/CI(2-1), CO(7-6)/CO(1-0) line ratios and the CO(7-6)/(far-IR continuum) luminosity ratio are compared to those of nearby objects. A large excitation status in the ISM of these high-z objects is seen, unless differential lensing unevenly boosts the CO line fluxes from the warm and dense gas more than the CO(1-0), CI(2-1), tracing a more widely distributed cold gas phase. We provide estimates of total molecular gas masses derived from the atomic carbon and the carbon monoxide CO(1-0), which within the uncertainties turn out to be equal.

	Abstract = {We explore the effects of the expected higher cosmic ray (CR) ionization rates  \zeta   CR  on the abundances of carbon monoxide (CO), atomic carbon (C), and ionized carbon (C+) in the H2 clouds of star-forming galaxies. The study of Bisbas et al. is expanded by (a) using realistic inhomogeneous giant molecular cloud (GMC) structures, (b) a detailed chemical analysis behind the CR-induced destruction of CO, and (c) exploring the thermal state of CR-irradiated molecular gas. CRs permeating the interstellar medium with  \zeta   CR ≳ 10× ( Galactic ) are found to significantly reduce the [CO]/[H2] abundance ratios throughout the mass of a GMC. CO rotational line imaging will then show much clumpier structures than the actual ones. For  \zeta   CR ≳ 100 ×  (Galactic) this bias becomes severe, limiting the usefulness of CO lines for recovering structural and dynamical characteristics of H2-rich galaxies throughout the universe, including many of the so-called main-sequence galaxies where the bulk of cosmic star formation occurs. Both C+ and C abundances increase with rising  \zeta   CR , with C remaining the most abundant of the two throughout H2 clouds, when  \zeta   CR ˜ (1-100) ×  (Galactic). C+ starts to dominate for  \zeta   CR ≳  10 3 ×  (Galactic). The thermal state of the gas in the inner and denser regions of GMCs is invariant with  T  gas ˜ 10   K   for  \zeta   CR ˜ (1-10) ×  (Galactic). For  \zeta   CR ˜  10 3 ×  (Galactic) this is no longer the case and  T  gas ˜ 30 -- 50   K   are reached. Finally, we identify OH as the key species whose T gas-sensitive abundance could mitigate the destruction of CO at high temperatures.},

	Abstract = {We present the results from a survey of 12CO emission in 40 luminous sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs), with 850-mum fluxes of S850 mum = 4-20 mJy, conducted with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. We detect 12CO emission in 32 SMGs at z ˜ 1.2-4.1, including 16 SMGs not previously published. Using multiple 12CO line (Jup = 2-7) observations, we derive a median spectral line energy distribution for luminous SMGs. We report the discovery of a fundamental relationship between 12CO FWHM and 12CO line luminosity in high-redshift starbursts, which we interpret as a natural consequence of the baryon-dominated dynamics within the regions probed by our observations. We use far-infrared luminosities to assess the star formation efficiency in our SMGs, finding that the slope of the L'CO-LFIR relation is close to linear. We derive molecular gas masses, finding a mean gas mass of (5.3 $\pm$ 1.0) × 1010 M&sun;. Combining these with dynamical masses, we determine the redshift evolution of the gas content of SMGs, finding that they do not appear to be significantly more gas rich than less vigorously star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. Finally, we collate X-ray observations, and study the interdependence of gas and dynamical properties of SMGs with their AGN activity and supermassive black hole masses (MBH), finding that SMGs lie significantly below the local MBH-sigma relation.},

	Abstract = {In the cold dark matter cosmology, the baryonic components of galaxies---stars and gas---are thought to be mixed with and embedded in non-baryonic and non-relativistic dark matter, which dominates the total mass of the galaxy and its dark-matter halo. In the local (low-redshift) Universe, the mass of dark matter within a galactic disk increases with disk radius, becoming appreciable and then dominant in the outer, baryonic regions of the disks of star-forming galaxies. This results in rotation velocities of the visible matter within the disk that are constant or increasing with disk radius---a hallmark of the dark-matter model. Comparisons between the dynamical mass, inferred from these velocities in rotational equilibrium, and the sum of the stellar and cold-gas mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation ten billion years ago, inferred from ancillary data, suggest high baryon fractions in the inner, star-forming regions of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than in the local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (owing to the chosen stellar initial-mass function and the calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons inconclusive in terms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves (showing rotation velocity as a function of disk radius) for the outer disks of six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation velocities are not constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this trend arises because of a combination of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the massive high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon-dominated, with dark matter playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the large velocity dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial pressure term that leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing radius. The effect of both factors appears to increase with redshift. Qualitatively, the observations suggest that baryons in the early (high-redshift) Universe efficiently condensed at the centres of dark-matter haloes when gas fractions were high and dark matter was less concentrated.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present fluxes in the [ CI ] lines of neutral carbon at the centers of some 76 galaxies with far-infrared luminosities ranging from 109 to 1012L&sun;, as obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory and ground-based facilities, along with the line fluxes of the J = 7-6, J = 4-3, J = 2-112CO, and J = 2-113CO transitions. With this dataset, we determine the behavior of the observed lines with respect to each other and then investigate whether they can be used to characterize the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) of the parent galaxies in simple ways and how the molecular gas properties define the model results. In most starburst galaxies, the [ CI ] to 13CO line flux ratio is much higher than in Galactic star-forming regions, and it is correlated to the total far-infrared luminosity. The [ CI ] (1-0)/12CO (4-3), the [ CI ] (2-1)/12CO (7-6), and the [ CI ] (2-1)/(1-0) flux ratios are correlated, and they trace the excitation of the molecular gas. In the most luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), the ISM is fully dominated by dense (n( H2) = 104-105 cm-3) and moderately warm (Tkin ≈ 30 K) gas clouds that appear to have low [C$\,^{\circ}$]/[CO] and [13CO]/[12CO] abundances. In less luminous galaxies, emission from gas clouds at lower densities becomes progressively more important, and a multiple-phase analysis is required to determine consistent physical characteristics. Neither the 12CO nor the [ CI ] velocity-integrated line fluxes are good predictors of molecular hydrogen column densities in individual galaxies. In particular, so-called X( [ CI ]) conversion factors are not superior to X( 12CO) factors. The methods and diagnostic diagrams outlined in this paper also provide a new and relatively straightforward means of deriving the physical characteristics of molecular gas in high-redshift galaxies up to z = 5, which are otherwise hard to determine.},

All of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range z = 2-6.5. The presence of the C IV absorption feature, indicating that the rest-frame UV-optical SED is dominated by OB stars, is used to select objects for which the intrinsic, unattenuated spectrum has a well-established shape. Comparison of this intrinsic spectrum with the observed broadband photometric SED then permits derivation of the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation. The derived dust attenuation curve is similar in overall shape to the Calzetti curve for local starburst galaxies. We also see the 2175 {\AA} bump feature which is present in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud extinction curves but not seen in the Calzetti curve. The bump feature is commonly attributed to graphite or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. No significant dependence is seen with redshift between sub-samples at z = 2-4 and z = 4-6.5. The "extinction" curve obtained here provides a firm basis for color and extinction corrections of high redshift galaxy photometry.},

	Volume = 463,
	Year = 2010,
	Abstract = {Stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. As this is relatively rare in the local Universe, galaxies like the Milky Way form only a few new stars per year. Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly. Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more molecular-gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far largely been restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars, and accordingly we do not yet have a clear idea about the gas content of more normal (albeit massive) galaxies. Here we report the results of a survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive-star-forming galaxies at mean redshifts <z> of about 1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was respectively 40% and 24% of its current age. Our measurements reveal that distant star forming galaxies were indeed gas rich, and that the star formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. The average fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z = 2.3 and z = 1.2 is respectively about 44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massive spiral galaxies. The slow decrease between z~2 and z~1 probably requires a mechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.},

	Volume = 853,
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {This paper provides an update of our previous scaling relations between galaxy-integrated molecular gas masses, stellar masses, and star formation rates (SFRs), in the framework of the star formation main sequence (MS), with the main goal of testing for possible systematic effects. For this purpose our new study combines three independent methods of determining molecular gas masses from CO line fluxes, far-infrared dust spectral energy distributions, and ˜1 mm dust photometry, in a large sample of 1444 star-forming galaxies between z = 0 and 4. The sample covers the stellar mass range log(M */M &sun;) = 9.0-11.8, and SFRs relative to that on the MS, deltaMS = SFR/SFR(MS), from 10-1.3 to 102.2. Our most important finding is that all data sets, despite the different techniques and analysis methods used, follow the same scaling trends, once method-to-method zero-point offsets are minimized and uncertainties are properly taken into account. The molecular gas depletion time t depl, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to SFR, scales as (1 + z)-0.6 × (deltaMS)-0.44 and is only weakly dependent on stellar mass. The ratio of molecular to stellar mass mu gas depends on (1+z{)}2.5× {(delta {MS})}0.52× {({M}* )}-0.36, which tracks the evolution of the specific SFR. The redshift dependence of mu gas requires a curvature term, as may the mass dependences of t depl and mu gas. We find no or only weak correlations of t depl and mu gas with optical size R or surface density once one removes the above scalings, but we caution that optical sizes may not be appropriate for the high gas and dust columns at high z.

	Abstract = {We report subarcsecond resolution IRAM PdBI millimeter CO interferometry of four z ~ 2 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), and sensitive CO(3-2) flux limits toward three z ~ 2 UV/optically selected star-forming galaxies. The new data reveal for the first time spatially resolved CO gas kinematics in the observed SMGs. Two of the SMGs show double or multiple morphologies, with complex, disturbed gas motions. The other two SMGs exhibit CO velocity gradients of ~500 km s-1 across <=0.2'' (1.6 kpc) diameter regions, suggesting that the star-forming gas is in compact, rotating disks. Our data provide compelling evidence that these SMGs represent extreme, short-lived "maximum" star-forming events in highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies. The resulting high-mass surface and volume densities of SMGs are similar to those of compact quiescent galaxies in the same redshift range and much higher than those in local spheroids. From the ratio of the comoving volume densities of SMGs and quiescent galaxies in the same mass and redshift ranges, and from the comparison of gas exhaustion timescales and stellar ages, we estimate that the SMG phase duration is about 100 Myr. Our analysis of SMGs and optically/UV selected high-redshift star-forming galaxies supports a "universal" Chabrier IMF as being valid over the star-forming history of these galaxies. We find that the 12CO luminosity to total gas mass conversion factors at z ~ 2-3 are probably similar to those assumed at z ~ 0. The implied gas fractions in our sample galaxies range from 20% to 50%.  Based on observations obtained at the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI).

	Abstract = {We present ~0.6" resolution IRAM PdBI interferometry of eight submillimeter galaxies at z~2-3.4, where we detect continuum at 1 mm and/or CO lines at 3 and 1 mm. The CO 3-2/4-3 line profiles in five of the sources are double-peaked, indicative of orbital motion either in a single rotating disk or of a merger of two galaxies. The millimeter line and continuum emission is compact; we marginally resolve the sources or obtain tight upper limits to their intrinsic sizes in all cases. The median FWHM diameter for these sources and the previously resolved sources, SMM J023952-0136 and SMM J140104+0252, is <=0.5" (4 kpc). The compactness of the sources does not support a scenario in which the far-IR/submillimeter emission comes from a cold (T<30 K), very extended dust distribution. These measurements clearly show that the submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) we have observed resemble scaled-up and more gas-rich versions of the local universe, ultraluminous galaxy population. Their central densities and potential well depths are much greater than those in other z~2-3 galaxy samples studied so far. They are comparable to those of elliptical galaxies or massive bulges. The SMG properties fulfill the criteria of ``maximal'' starbursts, in which most of the available initial gas reservoir of 1010-1011 Msolar is converted to stars on a timescale ~3-10tdyn~a few times 108 yr.

	Abstract = {We show that the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date, Cl J1001 at  z  spec =2.506, hosts a strong overdensity of radio sources. Six of them are individually detected (within 10\prime\prime ) in deep 0\buildrel \prime\prime \over .  75 resolution VLA 3 GHz imaging, with  S 3 GHz > 8 mu  Jy . Of the six, an active galactic nucleus (AGN) likely affects the radio emission in two galaxies, while star formation is the dominant source powering the remaining four. We searched for cluster candidates over the full COSMOS 2 deg2 field using radio-detected 3 GHz sources and looking for peaks in    Sigma    5 density maps. Cl J1001 is the strongest overdensity by far with > 10sigma , with a simple  z  phot > 1.5 preselection. A cruder photometric rejection of z< 1 radio foregrounds leaves Cl J1001 as the second strongest overdensity, while even using all radio sources Cl J1001 remains among the four strongest projected overdensities. We conclude that there are great prospects for future deep and wide-area radio surveys to discover large samples of the first generation of forming galaxy clusters. In these remarkable structures, widespread star formation and AGN activity of massive galaxy cluster members, residing within the inner cluster core, will ultimately lead to radio continuum as one of the most effective means for their identification, with detection rates expected in the ballpark of 0.1-1 per square degree at z≳ 2.5. Samples of hundreds such high-redshift clusters could potentially constrain cosmological parameters and test cluster and galaxy formation models.},

	Abstract = {We present a measurement of the spatial clustering of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) at z= 1-3. Using data from the 870 $\mu$m Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA) submillimetre survey of the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South, we employ a novel technique to measure the cross-correlation between SMGs and galaxies, accounting for the full probability distributions for photometric redshifts of the galaxies. From the observed projected two-point cross-correlation function we derive the linear bias and characteristic dark matter halo masses for the SMGs. We detect clustering in the cross-correlation between SMGs and galaxies at the >4$\sigma$ level. Accounting for the clustering of galaxies from their autocorrelation function, we estimate an autocorrelation length for SMGs of ? Mpc assuming a power-law slope $\gamma$= 1.8, and derive a corresponding dark matter halo mass of ?. Based on the evolution of dark matter haloes derived from simulations, we show that that the z= 0 descendants of SMGs are typically massive ({\~{ }}2-3L*) elliptical galaxies residing in moderate- to high-mass groups (?). From the observed clustering we estimate an SMG lifetime of {\~{ }}100 Myr, consistent with lifetimes derived from gas consumption times and star formation time-scales, although with considerable uncertainties. The clustering of SMGs at z{\~{ }} 2 is consistent with measurements for optically selected quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), supporting evolutionary scenarios in which powerful starbursts and QSOs occur in the same systems. Given that SMGs reside in haloes of characteristic mass {\~{ }}6 {\texttimes} 1012 h-1 M⊙, we demonstrate that the redshift distribution of SMGs can be described remarkably well by the combination of two effects: the cosmological growth of structure and the evolution of the molecular gas fraction in galaxies. We conclude that the powerful starbursts in SMGs likely represent a short-lived but universal phase in massive galaxy evolution, associated with the transition between cold gas-rich, star-forming galaxies and passively evolving systems.},

The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

	Abstract = {Optical surveys of the global star-formation rate in high-redshift galaxies show a strong peak in activity at a redshift of z ~ 1.5, which implies that most of the star formation has already been seen. High-redshift galaxies may, however, emit most of their energy at submillimetre wavelengths, if they contain substantial amounts of dust that absorbs the starlight and reradiates it as far-infrared light. Here we report a deep survey of a blank region of sky, performed at submillimetre wavelengths (450 and 850mum). We detect luminous sources in the 850-mum band which, if they have similar spectra to low-redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies and are primarily powered by star formation, must each be converting more than 100 solar masses of gas per year into stars: this is larger than themaximum star-formation rates inferred for most optically selected galaxies. The total amount of star formation at high redshifts is essentially fixed by the level of background light, but where the peak activity occurs at submillimetre wavelengths is not yet well established. However, the background light inferred from the sources that we have detected is already comparable to that from the optically selected sources. Establishing the main epoch of star formation will therefore require a combination of optical and submillimetre studies.},

	Abstract = {We present the Evolution of molecular Gas in Normal Galaxies (EGNoG) survey, an observational study of molecular gas in 31 star-forming galaxies from z = 0.05 to z = 0.5, with stellar masses of (4-30) × 1010 M &sun; and star formation rates of 4-100 M &sun; yr-1. This survey probes a relatively un-observed redshift range in which the molecular gas content of galaxies is expected to have evolved significantly. To trace the molecular gas in the EGNoG galaxies, we observe the CO(J = 1 --> 0) and CO(J = 3 --> 2) rotational lines using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 24 of 31 galaxies and present resolved maps of 10 galaxies in the lower redshift portion of the survey. We use a bimodal prescription for the CO to molecular gas conversion factor, based on specific star formation rate, and compare the EGNoG galaxies to a large sample of galaxies assembled from the literature. We find an average molecular gas depletion time of 0.76 $\pm$ 0.54 Gyr for normal galaxies and 0.06 $\pm$ 0.04 Gyr for starburst galaxies. We calculate an average molecular gas fraction of 7%-20% at the intermediate redshifts probed by the EGNoG survey. By expressing the molecular gas fraction in terms of the specific star formation rate and molecular gas depletion time (using typical values), we also calculate the expected evolution of the molecular gas fraction with redshift. The predicted behavior agrees well with the significant evolution observed from z ~ 2.5 to today.},

	Title = {{The gas fractions of dark matter haloes hosting simulated $\sim L^\star$ galaxies are governed by the feedback history of their black holes}},
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We examine the origin of scatter in the relationship between the gas fraction and mass of dark matter haloes hosting present-day $\sim L^\star$ central galaxies in the EAGLE simulations. The scatter is uncorrelated with the accretion rate of the central galaxy's black hole (BH), but correlates strongly and negatively with the BH's mass, implicating differences in the expulsion of gas by active galactic nucleus feedback, throughout the assembly of the halo, as the main cause of scatter. Haloes whose central galaxies host undermassive BHs also tend to retain a higher gas fraction, and exhibit elevated star formation rates (SFRs). Diversity in the mass of central BHs stems primarily from diversity in the dark matter halo binding energy, as these quantities are strongly and positively correlated at fixed halo mass, such that $\sim L^\star$ galaxies hosted by haloes that are more (less) tightly-bound develop central BHs that are more (less) massive than is typical for their halo mass. Variations in the halo gas fraction at fixed halo mass are reflected in both the soft X-ray luminosity and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, suggesting that the prediction of a strong coupling between the properties of galaxies and their halo gas fractions can be tested with measurements of these diagnostics for galaxies with diverse SFRs but similar halo masses.},

	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We analyse maps of the spatially-resolved nebular emission of $\approx$1500 star-forming galaxies at $z\approx0.6$-$2.2$ from deep KMOS and MUSE observations to measure the average shape of their rotation curves. We use these to test claims for declining rotation curves at large radii in galaxies at $z\approx1$-$2$ that have been interpreted as evidence for an absence of dark matter. We show that the shape of the average rotation curves, and the extent to which they decline beyond their peak velocities, depends upon the normalisation prescription used to construct the average curve. Normalising in size by the galaxy stellar disk-scale length ($R_ \rm d  $), we construct stacked position-velocity diagrams that trace the average galaxy rotation curve out to $6R_ \rm d  $ ($\approx$13 kpc, on average). Combining these curves with average HI rotation curves for local systems, we investigate how the shapes of galaxy rotation curves evolve over $\approx$10 Gyr. The average rotation curve for galaxies binned in stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and/or redshift is approximately flat, or continues to rise, out to at least $6R_ \rm d  $. We find a correlation between the outer slopes of galaxies' rotation curves and their stellar mass surface densities, with the higher surface density systems exhibiting flatter or less steeply rising rotation curves. Drawing comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the average shapes of the rotation curves for our sample of massive, star-forming galaxies at $z\approx0$-$2.2$ are consistent with those expected from $\Lambda$CDM theory and imply dark matter fractions within $6R_ \rm d  $ of at least $\approx60$ percent.},

	Abstract = {We present PHIBSS, the IRAM Plateau de Bure high-z blue sequence CO 3-2 survey of the molecular gas properties in massive, main-sequence star-forming galaxies (SFGs) near the cosmic star formation peak. PHIBSS provides 52 CO detections in two redshift slices at z ~ 1.2 and 2.2, with log(M *(M &sun;)) >= 10.4 and log(SFR(M &sun;/yr)) >= 1.5. Including a correction for the incomplete coverage of the M* -SFR plane, and adopting a "Galactic" value for the CO-H2 conversion factor, we infer average gas fractions of ~0.33 at z ~ 1.2 and ~0.47 at z ~ 2.2. Gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmological simulations including strong star formation feedback. Most of the z ~ 1-3 SFGs are rotationally supported turbulent disks. The sizes of CO and UV/optical emission are comparable. The molecular-gas-star-formation relation for the z = 1-3 SFGs is near-linear, with a ~0.7 Gyr gas depletion timescale; changes in depletion time are only a secondary effect. Since this timescale is much less than the Hubble time in all SFGs between z ~ 0 and 2, fresh gas must be supplied with a fairly high duty cycle over several billion years. At given z and M *, gas fractions correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate (sSFR). The variation of sSFR between z ~ 0 and 3 is mainly controlled by the fraction of baryonic mass that resides in cold gas.  Based on observations with the Plateau de Bure millimetre interferometer, operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy in the Millimetre Range (IRAM), which is funded by a partnership of INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).},

	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We present the first results of an ALMA survey of the lower fine structure line of atomic carbon [C I]$(^3P_1\,-\,^ 3 P_0)$ in far infrared-selected galaxies on the main sequence at $z\sim1.2$ in the COSMOS field. We compare our sample with a comprehensive compilation of data available in the literature for local and high-redshift starbursting systems and quasars. We show that the [C I]($^3P_1$$\rightarrow$$^3P_0$) luminosity correlates on global scales with the infrared luminosity $L_ \rm IR $ similarly to low-$J$ CO transitions. We report a systematic variation of $L'_ \rm [C\,I]^3P_1\,-\, ^3P_0 $/$L_ \rm IR $ as a function of the galaxy type, with the ratio being larger for main-sequence galaxies than for starbursts and sub-millimeter galaxies at fixed $L_ \rm IR $. The $L'_ \rm [C\,I]^3P_1\,-\, ^3P_0 $/$L'_ \rm CO(2-1) $ and $M_ \rm [C I]  $/$M_ \rm dust $ mass ratios are similar for main-sequence galaxies and for local and high-redshift starbursts within a 0.2 dex intrinsic scatter, suggesting that [C I] is a good tracer of molecular gas mass as CO and dust. We derive a fraction of $f_ \rm [C\,I]   = M_ \rm [C\,I]   / M_ \rm C  \sim3-13$% of the total carbon mass in the atomic neutral phase. Moreover, we estimate the neutral atomic carbon abundance, the fundamental ingredient to calibrate [C I] as a gas tracer, by comparing $L'_ \rm [C\,I]^3P_1\,-\, ^3P_0 $ and available gas masses from CO lines and dust emission. We find lower [C I] abundances in main-sequence galaxies than in starbursting systems and sub-millimeter galaxies, as a consequence of the canonical $\alpha_ \rm CO $ and gas-to-dust conversion factors. This argues against the application to different galaxy populations of a universal standard [C I] abundance derived from highly biased samples.},

The main prediction is that galaxies contained similar amounts of H I at redshift z ≈ 1-5 than today, but substantially more H2, in quantitative agreement with the strong molecular line emission already detected in a few high-redshift galaxies and approximately consistent with inferences from studies of the damped Lyman-alpha absorbers seen in the spectra of quasars. The cosmic H2/H I ratio is predicted to evolve monotonically as Omega_ H_2 /Omega_HI∝ (1+z)^ 1.6 . This decline of the H2/H I ratio as a function of cosmic time is driven by the growth of galactic disks and the progressive reduction of the mean cold gas pressure. Finally, a comparison between the evolutions of H I, H2, and SFRs reveals two distinct cosmic epochs of star formation: an early epoch (z gsim 3), driven by the evolution of Omega_HI+H_2(z), and a late epoch (z lsim 3), driven by the evolution of Omega_ H_2 (z)/Omega_HI(z).},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces Colossus, a public, open-source python package for calculations related to cosmology, the large-scale structure of matter in the universe, and the properties of dark matter halos. The code is designed to be fast and easy to use, with a coherent, well-documented user interface. The cosmology module implements FLRW cosmologies including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum, variance, and correlation function. The large-scale structure module is concerned with the properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense, including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid exploration of these quantities, Colossus implements more than 40 different fitting functions from the literature. I discuss the core routines in detail, with particular emphasis on their accuracy. Colossus is available at bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus.},

All known published and coded methods for sampling from the 3D NFW PDF use either accept-reject, or numeric interpolation (sometimes via a lookup table) for projecting random Uniform samples through the quantile distribution function to produce samples of the radius. This is a common requirement in N-body initial condition (IC), halo occupation distribution (HOD), and semi-analytic modelling (SAM) work for correctly assigning particles or galaxies to positions given an assumed concentration for the NFW profile. Using this analytic description allows for much faster and cleaner code to solve a common numeric problem in modern astronomy. We release R and Python versions of simple code that achieves this sampling, which we note is trivial to reproduce in any modern programming language.},

	Abstract = {We present the first stable release of Halotools (v0.2), a community-driven Python package designed to build and test models of the galaxy-halo connection. Halotools provides a modular platform for creating mock universes of galaxies starting from a catalog of dark matter halos obtained from a cosmological simulation. The package supports many of the common forms used to describe galaxy-halo models: the halo occupation distribution, the conditional luminosity function, abundance matching, and alternatives to these models that include effects such as environmental quenching or variable galaxy assembly bias. Satellite galaxies can be modeled to live in subhalos or to follow custom number density profiles within their halos, including spatial and/or velocity bias with respect to the dark matter profile. The package has an optimized toolkit to make mock observations on a synthetic galaxy population---including galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy group identification, RSD multipoles, void statistics, pairwise velocities and others---allowing direct comparison to observations. Halotools is object-oriented, enabling complex models to be built from a set of simple, interchangeable components, including those of your own creation. Halotools has an automated testing suite and is exhaustively documented on http://halotools.readthedocs.io, which includes quickstart guides, source code notes and a large collection of tutorials. The documentation is effectively an online textbook on how to build and study empirical models of galaxy formation with Python.},

	Title = {{An accurate halo model for fitting non-linear cosmological power spectra and baryonic feedback models}},
	Volume = 454,
	Year = 2015,
	Abstract = {We present an optimized variant of the halo model, designed to produce accurate matter power spectra well into the non-linear regime for a wide range of cosmological models. To do this, we introduce physically motivated free parameters into the halo-model formalism and fit these to data from high-resolution N-body simulations. For a variety of Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) and wCDM models, the halo-model power is accurate to ~= 5 per cent for k <= 10h Mpc-1 and z <= 2. An advantage of our new halo model is that it can be adapted to account for the effects of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum. We demonstrate this by fitting the halo model to power spectra from the OWLS (OverWhelmingly Large Simulations) hydrodynamical simulation suite via parameters that govern halo internal structure. We are able to fit all feedback models investigated at the 5 per cent level using only two free parameters, and we place limits on the range of these halo parameters for feedback models investigated by the OWLS simulations. Accurate predictions to high k are vital for weak-lensing surveys, and these halo parameters could be considered nuisance parameters to marginalize over in future analyses to mitigate uncertainty regarding the details of feedback. Finally, we investigate how lensing observables predicted by our model compare to those from simulations and from HALOFIT for a range of k-cuts and feedback models and quantify the angular scales at which these effects become important. Code to calculate power spectra from the model presented in this paper can be found at https://github.com/alexander-mead/hmcode.},

	Volume = 466,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {Cosmological N-body simulations predict dark matter (DM) haloes with steep central cusps (e.g. NFW). This contradicts observations of gas kinematics in low-mass galaxies that imply the existence of shallow DM cores. Baryonic processes such as adiabatic contraction and gas outflows can, in principle, alter the initial DM density profile, yet their relative contributions to the halo transformation remain uncertain. Recent high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by Di Cintio et al. (DC14) predict that inner density profiles depend systematically on the ratio of stellar-to-DM mass (M*/Mhalo). Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, we test the NFW and the M*/Mhalo-dependent DC14 halo models against a sample of 147 galaxy rotation curves from the new Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves data set. These galaxies all have extended H I rotation curves from radio interferometry as well as accurate stellar-mass-density profiles from near-infrared photometry. The DC14 halo profile provides markedly better fits to the data compared to the NFW profile. Unlike NFW, the DC14 halo parameters found in our rotation-curve fits naturally fall within two standard deviations of the mass-concentration relation predicted by Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) and the stellar mass-halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching with few outliers. Halo profiles modified by baryonic processes are therefore more consistent with expectations from LambdaCDM cosmology and provide better fits to galaxy rotation curves across a wide range of galaxy properties than do halo models that neglect baryonic physics. Our results offer a solution to the decade long cusp-core discrepancy.},

	Title = {{The Tight Empirical Relation between Dark Matter Halo Mass and Flat Rotation Velocity for Late-Type Galaxies}},
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We present a new empirical relation between galaxy dark matter halo mass (Mhalo) and the velocity along the flat portion of the rotation curve (Vflat), derived from 120 late-type galaxies from the SPARC database. The orthogonal scatter in this relation is comparable to the observed scatter in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), indicating a tight coupling between total halo mass and galaxy kinematics at r ≪ Rvir. The small vertical scatter in the relation makes it an extremely competitive estimator of total halo mass. We demonstrate that this conclusion holds true for different priors on M*/L[3.6mu] that give a tight BTFR, but requires that the halo density profile follows DC14 rather than NFW. We provide additional relations between Mhalo and other velocity definitions at smaller galactic radii (i.e. V2.2, Veff, and Vmax) which can be useful for estimating halo masses from kinematic surveys, providing an alternative to abundance matching. Furthermore, we constrain the dark matter analog of the Radial Acceleration Relation and also find its scatter to be small, demonstrating the fine balance between baryons and dark matter in their contribution to galaxy kinematics.},

	Year = 2013,
	Abstract = {Power-law relations between tracers of baryonic mass and rotational velocities of disk galaxies, so-called Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs), offer a wealth of applications in galaxy evolution and cosmology. However, measurements of rotational velocities require galaxy inclinations, which are difficult to measure, thus limiting the range of TFR studies. This work introduces a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for recovering the TFR in galaxy samples with limited or no information on inclinations. The robustness and accuracy of this method is demonstrated using virtual and real galaxy samples. Intriguingly, the MLE reliably recovers the TFR of all test samples, even without using any inclination measurements---that is, assuming a random sin i-distribution for galaxy inclinations. Explicitly, this "inclination-free MLE" recovers the three TFR parameters (zero-point, slope, scatter) with statistical errors only about 1.5 times larger than the best estimates based on perfectly known galaxy inclinations with zero uncertainty. Thus, given realistic uncertainties, the inclination-free MLE is highly competitive. If inclination measurements have mean errors larger than 10$\,^{\circ}$, it is better not to use any inclinations than to consider the inclination measurements to be exact. The inclination-free MLE opens interesting perspectives for future H I surveys by the Square Kilometer Array and its pathfinders.},

	Volume = 477,
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {The shape of a galaxy's spatially unresolved, globally integrated 21-cm emission line depends on its internal gas kinematics: galaxies with rotationally supported gas discs produce double-horned profiles with steep wings, while galaxies with dispersion-supported gas produce Gaussian-like profiles with sloped wings. Using mock observations of simulated galaxies from the FIRE project, we show that one can therefore constrain a galaxy's gas kinematics from its unresolved 21-cm line profile. In particular, we find that the kurtosis of the 21-cm line increases with decreasing V/sigma and that this trend is robust across a wide range of masses, signal-to-noise ratios, and inclinations. We then quantify the shapes of 21-cm line profiles from a morphologically unbiased sample of ˜2000 low-redshift, H I-detected galaxies with Mstar = 107-11 M&sun; and compare to the simulated galaxies. At Mstar ≳ 1010 M&sun;, both the observed and simulated galaxies produce double-horned profiles with low kurtosis and steep wings, consistent with rotationally supported discs. Both the observed and simulated line profiles become more Gaussian like (higher kurtosis and less-steep wings) at lower masses, indicating increased dispersion support. However, the simulated galaxies transition from rotational to dispersion support more strongly: at Mstar = 108-10 M&sun;, most of the simulations produce more Gaussian-like profiles than typical observed galaxies with similar mass, indicating that gas in the low-mass simulated galaxies is, on average, overly dispersion supported. Most of the lower-mass-simulated galaxies also have somewhat lower gas fractions than the median of the observed population. The simulations nevertheless reproduce the observed line-width baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is insensitive to rotational versus dispersion support.},

Assuming that a set of D-dimensional data points can be described by a (D - 1)-dimensional plane with intrinsic scatter, we derive the general likelihood function to be maximised to recover the best fitting model. Alongside the mathematical description, we also release the hyper-fit package for the R statistical language (http://github.com/asgr/hyper.fit) and a user-friendly web interface for online fitting (http://hyperfit.icrar.org). The hyper-fit package offers access to a large number of fitting routines, includes visualisation tools, and is fully documented in an extensive user manual. Most of the hyper-fit functionality is accessible via the web interface. In this paper, we include applications to toy examples and to real astronomical data from the literature: the mass-size, Tully-Fisher, Fundamental Plane, and mass-spin-morphology relations. In most cases, the hyper-fit solutions are in good agreement with published values, but uncover more information regarding the fitted model.},

	Abstract = {We present CO(1-0) observations obtained at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array for 14 z˜ 2 galaxies with existing CO(3-2) measurements, including 11 galaxies that contain active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). We combine this sample with an additional 15 z˜ 2 galaxies from the literature that have both CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) measurements in order to evaluate differences in CO excitation between SMGs and AGN host galaxies, to measure the effects of CO excitation on the derived molecular gas properties of these populations, and to look for correlations between the molecular gas excitation and other physical parameters. With our expanded sample of CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratio measurements, we do not find a statistically significant difference in the mean line ratio between SMGs and AGN host galaxies as can be found in the literature; we instead find  r  3,1 =1.03+/- 0.50 for AGN host galaxies and  r  3,1 =0.78+/- 0.27 for SMGs (or  r  3,1 =0.90+/- 0.40 for both populations combined). We also do not measure a statistically significant difference between the distributions of the line ratios for these populations at the p = 0.05 level, although this result is less robust. We find no excitation dependence on the index or offset of the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for the two CO lines, and we obtain indices consistent with N = 1 for the various subpopulations. However, including low-z ``normal'' galaxies increases our best-fit Schmidt-Kennicutt index to N˜ 1.2. While we do not reproduce correlations between the CO line width and luminosity, we do reproduce correlations between CO excitation and star-formation efficiency.},

	Volume = 861,
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We report the serendipitous discovery of a dusty, starbursting galaxy at z = 5.667 (hereafter called CRLE) in close physical association with the ``normal'' main-sequence galaxy HZ10 at z = 5.654. CRLE was identified by detection of [C II], [N II], and CO(2-1) line emission, making it the highest-redshift, most luminous starburst in the COSMOS field. This massive, dusty galaxy appears to be forming stars at a rate of at least 1500 M &sun; yr-1 in a compact region only ˜3 kpc in diameter. The dynamical and dust emission properties of CRLE suggest an ongoing merger driving the starburst, which is in a potentially intermediate stage relative to other known dusty galaxies at the same epoch. The ratio of [C II] to [N II] may suggest that an important (˜15%) contribution to the [C II] emission comes from a diffuse ionized gas component, which could be more extended than the dense, starbursting gas. CRLE appears to be located in a significant galaxy overdensity at the same redshift, potentially associated with a large-scale cosmic structure recently identified in a Lyman alpha-emitter survey. This overdensity suggests that CRLE and HZ10 reside in a protocluster environment, offering the tantalizing opportunity to study the effect of a massive starburst on protocluster star formation. Our findings support the interpretation that a significant fraction of the earliest galaxy formation may occur from the inside out, within the central regions of the most massive halos, while rapidly evolving into the massive galaxy clusters observed in the local universe.},

	Volume = 608,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {It is not yet known if the properties of molecular gas in distant protocluster galaxies are significantly affected by their environment as galaxies are in local clusters. Through a deep, 64 h of effective on-source integration with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we discovered a massive, Mmol = 2.0 $\pm$ 0.2× 1011 M&sun;, extended,  40 kpc, CO(1-0)-emitting disk in the protocluster surrounding the radio galaxy, MRC 1138-262. The galaxy, at zCO = 2.1478, is a clumpy, massive disk galaxy, M*   5 × 1011 M&sun;, which lies 250 kpc in projection from MRC 1138-262 and is a known Halpha emitter, named HAE229. This source has a molecular gas fraction of  30%. The CO emission has a kinematic gradient along its major axis, centered on the highest surface brightness rest-frame optical emission, consistent with HAE229 being a rotating disk. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of the CO emission lies outside of the UV/optical emission. In spite of this, HAE229 follows the same relation between star-formation rate and molecular gas mass as normal field galaxies. HAE229 is the first CO(1-0) detection of an ordinary, star-forming galaxy in a protocluster. We compare a sample of cluster members at z > 0.4 thatare detected in low-order CO transitions, with a similar sample of sources drawn from the field. We confirm findings that the CO-luminosity and full-width at half maximum are correlated in starbursts and show that this relation is valid for normal high-z galaxies as well as for those in overdensities. We do not find a clear dichotomy in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for protocluster and field galaxies. Our results suggest that environment does not have an impact on the "star-formation efficiency" or the molecular gas content of high-redshift galaxies. Not finding any environmental dependence in these characteristics, especially for such an extended CO disk, suggests that environmentally-specific processes such as ram pressure stripping do not operate efficiently in (proto)clusters.

	Abstract = {We present a census of the molecular gas properties of galaxies in the most distant known X-ray cluster, CLJ1001, at z = 2.51, using deep observations of CO(1-0) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. In total, 14 cluster members with M * > 1010.5 M &sun; are detected, including all of the massive star-forming members within the virial radius, providing the largest galaxy sample in a single cluster at z > 2 with CO(1-0) measurements. We find a large variety in the gas content of these cluster galaxies, which is correlated with their relative positions (or accretion states), with those closer to the cluster core being increasingly gas-poor. Moreover, despite their low gas content, the galaxies in the cluster center exhibit an elevated star formation efficiency (SFE; SFE = SFR/M gas) compared to field galaxies, suggesting that the suppression on the SFR is likely delayed compared to that on the gas content. Their gas depletion time is around t dep ~ 400 Myr, which is comparable to the cluster dynamical time. This implies that they will consume all of their gas within a single orbit around the cluster center, and form a passive cluster core by z ~ 2. This result is one of the first direct pieces of evidence for the influence of environment on the gas reservoirs and SFE of z > 2 cluster galaxies, thereby providing new insights into the rapid formation and quenching of the most massive galaxies in the early universe.},

	Title = {{Predicting extragalactic distance errors using Bayesian inference in multi-measurement catalogs}},
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We propose two methods for robustly estimating extragalactic distance errors in multi-measurement catalogs. We seek to improve upon more commonly used frequentist propagation-of-error methods, as they fail to explain both the scatter between different measurements and the effects of skewness in the metric distance probability distribution. For individual galaxies, the most transparent way to assess the variance of redshift independent distances is to directly sample the posterior probability distribution obtained from the mixture of reported measurements. However, sampling the posterior can be cumbersome for catalog-wide precision cosmology applications. We compare the performance of frequentist methods versus our proposed measures for estimating the true variance of the metric distance probability distribution. We provide pre-computed distance error data tables for galaxies in 3 catalogs: NED-D, HyperLEDA, and Cosmicflows-3. From a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based analysis of systematic and random effects in the computed errors, we develop a predictive Bayesian model for the variance of distance errors for Tully-Fisher relation (TF) derived distances in NED-D. We validate this model with a Bayesian $p$-value computed using the Freeman-Tukey discrepancy measure as a posterior predictive check. We are then able to predict distance errors for 818 galaxies in the NED-D catalog which do not report TF distance modulus errors. Our goal is that our pre-computed errors are used in catalog-wide applications that require acknowledging the true variance of extragalactic distance measurements.},

	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We report the detection of CO(2-1) line emission from a Lyman Break Galaxy at $z\sim5.7$ with the VLA. The CO line luminosity implies a massive molecular gas reservoir of $(1.3\pm0.3)(\alpha_ \rm CO /4.5\,M_\odot$ (K km s$^ -1 $ pc$^2)^ -1 )\times10^ 11 \,M_\odot$, suggesting low star formation efficiency, with a gas depletion timescale of order $\sim$1 Gyr. This efficiency is much lower than traditionally observed in $z\gtrsim5$ starbursts, indicating that star forming conditions in Main Sequence galaxies at $z\sim6$ may be comparable to those of normal galaxies probed up to $z\sim3$ to-date, but with rising gas fractions across the entire redshift range. We also obtain a deep CO upper limit for a Main Sequence galaxy at $z\sim5.3$ with $\sim3$ times lower SFR, perhaps implying a high $\alpha_ \rm CO $ conversion factor, as typically found in low metallicity galaxies. Using ALMA, we find faint [NII] 205$\,\mu$m emission relative to [CII] in all but the most IR-luminous "normal" galaxies at $z=5-6$ for a sample including both CO targets, suggesting more intense or harder radiation fields in the ionized gas relative to lower redshift. These radiation properties indicate low metallicity may be common in typical $\sim$10$^ 10 \,M_\odot$ galaxies at $z=5-6$, consistent with our CO measurements. Our sample shows evidence for high dust temperatures, and a young starburst producing high radiation intensity and hardness even with substantial dust obscuration. While a fraction of Main Sequence star formation in the first billion years may take place in conditions not dissimilar to lower redshift, lower metallicity may affect the remainder of the population.},

	Abstract = {We present GALARIO, a computational library that exploits the power of modern graphical processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the analysis of observations from radio interferometers like Atacama Large Millimeter and sub-millimeter Array or the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. GALARIO speeds up the computation of synthetic visibilities from a generic 2D model image or a radial brightness profile (for axisymmetric sources). On a GPU, GALARIO is 150 faster than standard PYTHON and 10 times faster than serial C++ code on a CPU. Highly modular, easy to use, and to adopt in existing code, GALARIO comes as two compiled libraries, one for Nvidia GPUs and one for multicore CPUs, where both have the same functions with identical interfaces. GALARIO comes with PYTHON bindings but can also be directly used in C or C++. The versatility and the speed of GALARIO open new analysis pathways that otherwise would be prohibitively time consuming, e.g. fitting high-resolution observations of large number of objects, or entire spectral cubes of molecular gas emission. It is a general tool that can be applied to any field that uses radio interferometer observations.

	Title = {{Physical Conditions in the Interstellar Medium of Intensely Star-Forming Galaxies at Redshift\~{}2}},
	Volume = 699,
	Year = 2009,
	Abstract = {We analyze the physical conditions in the interstellar gas of 11 actively star-forming galaxies at z~2, based on integral-field spectroscopy from the ESO-VLT and Hubble Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer imaging. We concentrate on the high Hα surface brightnesses, large line widths, line ratios, and the clumpy nature of these galaxies. We show that photoionization calculations and emission line diagnostics imply gas pressures and densities that are similar to the most intense nearby star-forming regions at z = 0 but over much larger scales (10-20 kpc). A relationship between surface brightness and velocity dispersion can be explained through simple energy injection arguments and a scaling set by nearby galaxies with no free parameters. The high velocity dispersions are a natural consequence of intense star formation thus regions of high velocity dispersion are not evidence for mass concentrations such as bulges or rings. External mechanisms such as cosmological gas accretion generally do not have enough energy to sustain the high velocity dispersions. In some cases, the high pressures and low gas metallicites may make it difficult to robustly distinguish between active galactic nucleus ionization cones and star formation, as we show for BzK-15504 at z = 2.38. We construct a picture where the early stages of galaxy evolution are driven by self-gravity which powers strong turbulence until the velocity dispersion is high. Then massive, dense, gas-rich clumps collapse, triggering star formation with high efficiencies and intensities as observed. At this stage, the intense star formation is likely self-regulated by the mechanical energy output of massive stars.

	Volume = 809,
	Year = 2015,
	Abstract = {We present Karl Jansky Very Large Array observations of the CO J=1-0 transition in a sample of four z˜ 2 main-sequence galaxies. These galaxies are in the blue sequence of star-forming galaxies at their redshift, and are part of the IRAM Plateau de Bure HIgh-z Blue Sequence Survey which imaged them in CO J=3-2. Two galaxies are imaged here at high signal-to-noise, allowing determinations of their disk sizes, line profiles, molecular surface densities, and excitation. Using these and published measurements, we show that the CO and optical disks have similar sizes in main-sequence galaxies, and in the galaxy where we can compare CO J=1-0 and J=3-2 sizes we find these are also very similar. Assuming a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion, we measure surface densities of    Σ     mol ˜ 1200  M ⊙  pc-2 in projection and estimate    Σ     mol ˜ 500-900  M ⊙  pc-2 deprojected. Finally, our data yields velocity-integrated Rayleigh-Jeans brightness temperature line ratios r31 that are approximately at unity. In addition to the similar disk sizes, the very similar line profiles in J=1-0 and J=3-2 indicate that both transitions sample the same kinematics, implying that their emission is coextensive. We conclude that in these two main-sequence galaxies there is no evidence for significant excitation gradients or a large molecular reservoir that is diffuse or cold and not involved in active star formation. We suggest that r31 in very actively star-forming galaxies is likely an indicator of how well-mixed the star formation activity and the molecular reservoir are.},

	Abstract = {We present detections of the CO(J = 1-0) emission line in a sample of four massive star-forming galaxies at z ˜ 1.5-2.2 obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Combining these observations with previous CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) detections of these galaxies, we study the excitation properties of the molecular gas in our sample sources. We find an average line brightness temperature ratios of R21 = 0.70 $\pm$ 0.16 and R31 = 0.50 $\pm$ 0.29, based on measurements for three and two galaxies, respectively. These results provide additional support to previous indications of sub-thermal gas excitation for the CO(3-2) line with a typically assumed line ratio R31 ˜ 0.5. For one of our targets, BzK-21000, we present spatially resolved CO line maps. At the resolution of 0.18 arcsec (1.5 kpc), most of the emission is resolved out except for some clumpy structure. From this, we attempt to identify molecular gas clumps in the data cube, finding four possible candidates. We estimate that <40 per cent of the molecular gas is confined to giant clumps (˜1.5 kpc in size), and thus most of the gas could be distributed in small fainter clouds or in fairly diffuse extended regions of lower brightness temperatures than our sensitivity limit.},

	Volume = 859,
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {We derive 2D dust attenuation maps at ˜1 kpc resolution from the UV continuum for 10 galaxies on the z ˜ 2 star-forming main sequence (SFMS). Comparison with IR data shows that 9 out of 10 galaxies do not require further obscuration in addition to the UV-based correction, though our sample does not include the most heavily obscured, massive galaxies. The individual rest-frame V-band dust attenuation (A V) radial profiles scatter around an average profile that gently decreases from ˜1.8 mag in the center down to ˜0.6 mag at ˜3-4 half-mass radii. We use these maps to correct UV- and Halpha-based star formation rates (SFRs), which agree with each other. At masses ≲  10 11  M &sun; , the dust-corrected specific SFR (sSFR) profiles are on average radially constant at a mass-doubling timescale of ˜300 Myr, pointing at a synchronous growth of bulge and disk components. At masses ≳  10 11  M &sun; , the sSFR profiles are typically centrally suppressed by a factor of ˜10 relative to the galaxy outskirts. With total central obscuration disfavored, this indicates that at least a fraction of massive z ˜ 2 SFMS galaxies have started their inside-out star formation quenching that will move them to the quenched sequence. In combination with other observations, galaxies above and below the ridge of the SFMS relation have, respectively, centrally enhanced and centrally suppressed sSFRs relative to their outskirts, supporting a picture where bulges are built owing to gas ``compaction'' that leads to a high central SFR as galaxies move toward the upper envelope of the SFMS.

	Abstract = {We present the ``SINS/zC-SINF AO survey'' of 35 star-forming galaxies, the largest sample with deep adaptive optics (AO)--assisted near-infrared integral field spectroscopy at z ~ 2. The observations, taken with SINFONI at the Very Large Telescope, resolve the Halpha and [N II] emission and kinematics on scales of ~1.5 kpc. The sample probes the massive (M * ~ 2 × 109 - 3 × 1011 M &sun;), actively star-forming (SFR ~ 10--600 M &sun; yr-1) part of the z ~ 2 galaxy population over a wide range of colors ((U - V)rest ~ 0.15--1.5 mag) and half-light radii (R  e,H  ~ 1--8.5 kpc). The sample overlaps largely with the ``main sequence'' of star-forming galaxies in the same redshift range to a similar K AB = 23 mag limit; it has ~0.3 dex higher median specific SFR, ~0.1 mag bluer median (U - V)rest color, and ~10% larger median rest-optical size. We describe the observations, data reduction, and extraction of basic flux and kinematic properties. With typically 3--4 times higher resolution and 4--5 times longer integrations (up to 23 hr) than the seeing-limited data sets of the same objects, the AO data reveal much more detail in morphology and kinematics. The complete AO observations confirm the majority of kinematically classified disks and the typically elevated disk velocity dispersions previously reported based on subsets of the data. We derive typically flat or slightly negative radial [N II]/  H  alpha  gradients, with no significant trend with global galaxy properties, kinematic nature, or the presence of an AGN. Azimuthal variations in [N II]/  H  alpha  are seen in several sources and are associated with ionized gas outflows and possibly more metal-poor star-forming clumps or small companions.

	Title = {{Molecular and Ionized Gas Phases of an AGN-driven Outflow in a Typical Massive Galaxy at z{\nbsp}{\ap}{\nbsp}2}},
	Volume = 871,
	Year = 2019,
	Abstract = {Nuclear outflows driven by accreting massive black holes are one of the main feedback mechanisms invoked at high-z to reproduce the distinct separation between star-forming disk galaxies and quiescent spheroidal systems. Yet our knowledge of feedback at high-z remains limited by the lack of observations of the multiple gas phases in galaxy outflows. In this work, we use new deep, high spatial resolution ALMA CO(3--2) and archival Very Large Telescope/SINFONI Halpha observations to study the molecular and ionized components of the active galactic nucleus (AGN)--driven outflow in zC400528, a massive main-sequence galaxy at z = 2.3 in the process of quenching. We detect a powerful molecular outflow that shows a positive velocity gradient before a turnover and extends for at least ~10 kpc from the nuclear region, about three times the projected size of the ionized wind. The molecular gas in the outflow does not reach velocities high enough to escape the galaxy and is therefore expected to be reaccreted. Keeping in mind the various assumptions involved in the analysis, we find that the mass and energetics of the outflow are dominated by the molecular phase. The AGN-driven outflow in zC400528 is powerful enough to deplete the molecular gas reservoir on a timescale comparable to that needed to exhaust it by star formation. This suggests that the nuclear outflow is one of the main quenching engines at work in the observed suppression of the central star formation activity in zC400528.},

	Title = {{Bulge-forming Galaxies with an Extended Rotating Disk at z \~{} 2}},
	Volume = 834,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {We present 0."2-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at 870 mum for 25 Halpha-seleced star-forming galaxies around the main sequence at z = 2.2-2.5. We detect significant 870 mum continuum emission in 16 (64%) of these galaxies. The high-resolution maps reveal that the dust emission is mostly radiated from a single region close to the galaxy center. Exploiting the visibility data taken over a wide uv distance range, we measure the half-light radii of the rest-frame far-infrared emission for the best sample of 12 massive galaxies with log(M*/M&sun;) > 11. We find nine galaxies to be associated with extremely compact dust emission with R1/2,870 mum < 1.5 kpc, which is more than a factor of 2 smaller than their rest-optical sizes, <  R 1/2,1.6mu   m  > =3.2  kpc , and is comparable with optical sizes of massive quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. As they have an exponential disk with S{\'e}rsic index of <  n 1.6mu   m  > =1.2 in the rest-optical, they are likely to be in the transition phase from extended disks to compact spheroids. Given their high star formation rate surface densities within the central 1 kpc of <   Sigma     SFR  1 kpc > =40 M&sun; yr-1 kpc-2, the intense circumnuclear starbursts can rapidly build up a central bulge with SigmaM*,1 kpc > 1010 M&sun; kpc-2 in several hundred megayears, I.e., by z ˜ 2. Moreover, ionized gas kinematics reveal that they are rotation supported with an angular momentum as large as that of typical star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3. Our results suggest that bulges are commonly formed in extended rotating disks by internal processes, not involving major mergers.},

	Volume = 841,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {We explore the Halpha emission in the massive quiescent galaxies observed by the KMOS3D survey at 0.7 < z < 2.7. The Halpha line is robustly detected in 20 out of 120 UVJ-selected quiescent galaxies, and we classify the emission mechanism using the Halpha line width and the [N II]/Halpha line ratio. We find that AGNs are likely to be responsible for the line emission in more than half of the cases. We also find robust evidence for star formation activity in nine quiescent galaxies, which we explore in detail. The Halpha kinematics reveal rotating disks in five of the nine galaxies. The dust-corrected Halpha star formation rates are low (0.2-7 M &sun; yr-1), and place these systems significantly below the main sequence. The 24 mum-based, infrared luminosities, instead, overestimate the star formation rates. These galaxies present a lower gas-phase metallicity compared to star-forming objects with similar stellar mass, and many of them have close companions. We therefore conclude that the low-level star formation activity in these nine quiescent galaxies is likely to be fueled by inflowing gas or minor mergers, and could be a sign of rejuvenation events.

	Title = {{Rotating Starburst Cores in Massive Galaxies at z = 2.5}},
	Volume = 841,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the CO J=3-2 emission line in two massive galaxies at z = 2.5 on the star-forming main sequence. Both galaxies have compact dusty star-forming cores with effective radii of  R   e  =1.3+/- 0.1  kpc  and  R   e  =1.2+/- 0.1  kpc  in the 870 mum continuum emission. The spatial extent of star-forming molecular gas is also compact with  R   e  =1.9+/- 0.4  kpc  and  R   e  =2.3+/- 0.4  kpc , but more extended than the dust emission. Interpreting the observed position-velocity diagrams with dynamical models, we find the starburst cores to be rotation dominated with the ratio of the maximum rotation velocity to the local velocity dispersion of  v \max / sigma  0= 7.0 -2.8+2.5 ( v \max = 386 -32+36 km s-1) and  v \max / sigma  0= 4.1 -1.5+1.7 ( v \max = 391 -41+54 km s-1). Given that the descendants of these massive galaxies in the local universe are likely ellipticals with v/sigma  nearly an order of magnitude lower, the rapidly rotating galaxies would lose significant net angular momentum in the intervening time. The comparisons among dynamical, stellar, gas, and dust mass suggest that the starburst CO-to-H2 conversion factor of  alpha   CO =0.8  M &sun;  (K km s-1 pc-2)-1 is appropriate in the spatially resolved cores. The dense cores are likely to be formed in extreme environments similar to the central regions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Our work also demonstrates that a combination of medium-resolution CO and high-resolution dust continuum observations is a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamical state of molecular gas in distant galaxies.},

	Volume = 842,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {We investigate the stellar mass and baryonic mass Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) of massive star-forming disk galaxies at redshift z˜ 2.3 and z˜ 0.9 as part of the   KMOS  3  D   integral field spectroscopy survey. Our spatially resolved data allow reliable modeling of individual galaxies, including the effect of pressure support on the inferred gravitational potential. At fixed circular velocity, we find higher baryonic masses and similar stellar masses at z˜ 2.3 as compared to z˜ 0.9. Together with the decreasing gas-to-stellar mass ratios with decreasing redshift, this implies that the contribution of dark matter to the dynamical mass on the galaxy scale increases toward lower redshift. A comparison to local relations reveals a negative evolution of the stellar and baryonic TFR zero points from z = 0 to z˜ 0.9, no evolution of the stellar TFR zero point from z˜ 0.9 to z˜ 2.3, and a positive evolution of the baryonic TFR zero point from z˜ 0.9 to z˜ 2.3. We discuss a toy model of disk galaxy evolution to explain the observed nonmonotonic TFR evolution, taking into account the empirically motivated redshift dependencies of galactic gas fractions and the relative amount of baryons to dark matter on galaxy and halo scales.

The kinematic tracers agree well, indicating that both gas phases are subject to the same gravitational potential and physical processes affecting the gas dynamics. We combine the one-dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion profiles in CO and Halpha to forward-model the galaxy in a Bayesian framework, combining a thick exponential disk, a bulge, and a dark matter halo. We determine the dynamical support due to baryons and dark matter, and find a dark matter fraction within one effective radius of  f DM (<=slant  R e)= 0.18 -0.04+0.06.

The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

	Title = {{CO, H2O, H2O+ line and dust emission in a z = 3.63 strongly lensed starburst merger at sub-kiloparsec scales}},
	Year = 2019,
	Abstract = {Using ALMA, we report high angular-resolution observations of the redshift z=3.63 galaxy, G09v1.97, one of the most luminous strongly lensed galaxies discovered by the H-ATLAS survey. We present 0"2-0"4 resolution images of the rest-frame 188 and 419$\mu$m dust continuum and the CO(6-5), H2O(211-202) and J=2 H2O+ line emission. We also report the detection of H$_2^ 18 $O in this source. The dust continuum and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete ~1"5 diameter Einstein ring plus a weaker image in the center, which is caused by a special dual deflector lensing configuration. The observed line profiles of the CO, H2O and H2O+ lines are strikingly similar. In the source plane, we reconstruct the dust continuum images and the spectral cubes of the line emission at sub-kpc scales. The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective radius of 0.7kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average magnification for the dust continuum is $\mu$~10-11, the magnification of the line emission varies 5 to 22 across different velocity components. The emission lines have similar spatial and kinematic distributions. The molecular gas and dust content reveal that G09v1.97 is a gas-rich major merger in its pre-coalescence phase. Both of the merging companions are intrinsically ULIRGs with LIR reaching $\gtrsim 4\times10^ 12 L_\odot$, and the total LIR of G09v1.97 is $1.4\times10^ 13 L_\odot$. The approaching southern galaxy shows no obvious kinematic structure with a semi-major half-light radius a_s=0.4kpc, while the receding galaxy resembles an a_s=1.2kpc rotating disk. The two galaxies are separated by a projected distance of 1.3kpc, bridged by weak line emission that is co-spatially located with the cold-dust-emission peak, suggesting a large amount of cold ISM in the interacting region.

	Volume = 429,
	Year = 2013,
	Abstract = {We use interferometric 12CO(1-0) observations to compare and contrast the extent, surface brightness profiles and kinematics of the molecular gas in CO-rich ATLAS3D early-type galaxies (ETGs) and spiral galaxies. We find that the molecular gas extent is smaller in absolute terms in ETGs than in late-type galaxies, but that the size distributions are similar once scaled by the galaxies optical/stellar characteristic scalelengths. Amongst ETGs, we find that the extent of the gas is independent of its kinematic misalignment (with respect to the stars), but does depend on the environment, with Virgo cluster ETGs having less extended molecular gas reservoirs, further emphasizing that cluster ETGs follow different evolutionary pathways from those in the field. Approximately half of ETGs have molecular gas surface brightness profiles that follow the stellar light profile. These systems often have relaxed gas out to large radii, suggesting they are unlikely to have had recent merger/accretion events. A third of the sample galaxies show molecular gas surface brightness profiles that fall off slower than the light, and sometimes show a truncation. These galaxies often have a low mass, and either have disturbed molecular gas or are in the Virgo cluster, suggesting that recent mergers, ram pressure stripping and/or the presence of hot gas can compress/truncate the gas. The remaining galaxies have rings, or composite profiles, that we argue can be caused by the effects of bars. We investigated the kinematics of the molecular gas using position-velocity diagrams, and compared the observed kinematics with dynamical model predictions, and the observed stellar and ionized gas velocities. We confirm that the molecular gas reaches beyond the turnover of the circular velocity curve in ≈70 per cent of our CO-rich ATLAS3D ETGs, validating previous work on the CO Tully-Fisher relation. In general we find that in most galaxies the molecular gas is dynamically cold, and the observed CO rotation matches well model predictions of the circular velocity. In the galaxies with the largest molecular masses, dust obscuration and/or population gradients can cause model predictions of the circular velocity to disagree with observations of the molecular gas rotation; however, these effects are confined to the most star forming systems. Bars and non-equilibrium conditions can also make the gas deviate from circular orbits. In both these cases, one expects the model circular velocity to be higher than the observed CO velocity, in agreement with our observations. Molecular gas is a better direct tracer of the circular velocity than the ionized gas, justifying its use as a kinematic tracer for Tully-Fisher and similar analyses.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the S{\'e}rsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the S{\'e}rsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the S{\'e}rsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Volume = 152,
	Year = 2016,
	Abstract = {The H I and CO components of the interstellar medium (ISM) are usually used to derive the dynamical mass  M   dyn   of nearby galaxies. Both components become too faint to be used as a tracer in observations of high-redshift galaxies. In those cases, the 158 mum line of atomic carbon ([C II]) may be the only way to derive  M   dyn  . As the distribution and kinematics of the ISM tracer affects the determination of  M   dyn  , it is important to quantify the relative distributions of H I, CO, and [C II]. H I and CO are well-characterized observationally, however, for [C II] only very few measurements exist. Here we compare observations of CO, H I, and [C II] emission of a sample of nearby galaxies, drawn from the HERACLES, THINGS, and KINGFISH surveys. We find that within R 25, the average [C II] exponential radial profile is slightly shallower than that of the CO, but much steeper than the H I distribution. This is also reflected in the integrated spectrum (``global profile''), where the [C II] spectrum looks more like that of the CO than that of the H I. For one galaxy, a spectrally resolved comparison of integrated spectra was possible; other comparisons were limited by the intrinsic line-widths of the galaxies and the coarse velocity resolution of the [C II] data. Using high-spectral-resolution SOFIA [C II] data of a number of star forming regions in two nearby galaxies, we find that their [C II] linewidths agree better with those of the CO than the H I. As the radial extent of a given ISM tracer is a key input in deriving  M   dyn   from spatially unresolved data, we conclude that the relevant length-scale to use in determining  M   dyn   based on [C II] data, is that of the well-characterized CO distribution. This length scale is similar to that of the optical disk.},

	Volume = 468,
	Year = 2007,
	Abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers in which the kinematics of disk galaxies over a range of scales is scrutinised by employing spectroscopy. A fundamental aspect of these studies is presented here: the new publicly available software tool TiRiFiC (http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/˜gjozsa/tirific.html) enables a direct fit of a ``tilted-ring model'' to spectroscopic data cubes. The algorithm generates model data cubes from the tilted-ring parametrisation of a rotating disk, which are automatically adjusted to reach an optimum fit via a chi-squared minimisation method to an observed data cube. The structure of the new software, the shortcomings of the previously available programs to produce a tilted-ring model, and the performance of TiRiFiC are discussed. Our method is less affected by the well-known problem of beam smearing that occurs when fitting to the velocity field. Since we fit many data points in a data cube simultaneously with our method, TiRiFiC is sensitive to very faint structures so can be used to derive tilted-ring models significantly extending in radius beyond those derived from a velocity field. The software is able to parametrise H I disks of galaxies that are intersected by the line-of-sight twice or more, i.e. if the disks are heavily warped, and/or with a significant shift of the projected centre of rotation, and/or if seen edge-on. Furthermore, our method delivers the surface-brightness profile of the examined galaxy in addition to the orientational parameters and the rotation curve. In order to derive kinematic and morphological models of disk galaxies, especially reliable rotation curves, a direct-fit method as implemented in our code should be the tool of choice.},

	Abstract = {Kinematical parametrizations of disc galaxies, employing emission line observations, are indispensable tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies. Future large-scale H I surveys will resolve the discs of many thousands of galaxies, allowing a statistical analysis of their disc and halo kinematics, mass distribution and dark matter content. Here, we present an automated procedure which fits tilted-ring models to H I data cubes of individual, well-resolved galaxies. The method builds on the 3D Tilted Ring Fitting Code (TIRIFIC) and is called Fully Automated TIRIFIC (FAT). To assess the accuracy of the code, we apply it to a set of 52 artificial galaxies and 25 real galaxies from the Local Volume H I Survey (LVHIS). Using LVHIS data, we compare our 3D modelling to the 2D modelling methods DISKFIT and ROTCUR. A conservative result is that FAT accurately models the kinematics and the morphologies of galaxies with an extent of eight beams across the major axis in the inclination range 20$\,^{\circ}$-90$\,^{\circ}$ without the need for priors such as disc inclination. When comparing to 2D methods we find that velocity fields cannot be used to determine inclinations in galaxies that are marginally resolved. We conclude that with the current code tilted-ring models can be produced in a fully automated fashion. This will be essential for future H I surveys, with the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders, which will allow us to model the gas kinematics of many thousands of well-resolved galaxies. Performance studies of FAT close to our conservative limits, as well as the introduction of more parametrized models will open up the possibility to study even less resolved galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to constrain galaxy parameters directly from three-dimensional data cubes. The algorithm compares directly the data with a parametric model mapped in x,y,lambda  coordinates. It uses the spectral line-spread function and the spatial point-spread function (PSF) to generate a three-dimensional kernel whose characteristics are instrument specific or user generated. The algorithm returns the intrinsic modeled properties along with both an ``intrinsic'' model data cube and the modeled galaxy convolved with the 3D kernel. The algorithm uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach with a nontraditional proposal distribution in order to efficiently probe the parameter space. We demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm using 1728 mock galaxies and galaxies generated from hydrodynamical simulations in various seeing conditions from 0."6 to 1."2. We find that the algorithm can recover the morphological parameters (inclination, position angle) to within 10% and the kinematic parameters (maximum rotation velocity) to within 20%, irrespectively of the PSF in seeing (up to 1."2) provided that the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is greater than ˜3 pixel-1 and that the ratio of galaxy half-light radius to seeing radius is greater than about 1.5. One can use such an algorithm to constrain simultaneously the kinematics and morphological parameters of (nonmerging) galaxies observed in nonoptimal seeing conditions. The algorithm can also be used on adaptive optics data or on high-quality, high-S/N data to look for nonaxisymmetric structures in the residuals.},

	Title = {{galpy: A python Library for Galactic Dynamics}},
	Volume = 216,
	Year = 2015,
	Abstract = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation.

	Title = {{Calibration of LOFAR data on the cloud}},
	Volume = 19,
	Year = 2017,
	Abstract = {New scientific instruments are starting to generate an unprecedented amount of data. The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), one of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinders, is already producing data on a petabyte scale. The calibration of these data presents a huge challenge for final users: (a) extensive storage and computing resources are required; (b) the installation and maintenance of the software required for the processing is not trivial; and (c) the requirements of calibration pipelines, which are experimental and under development, are quickly evolving. After encountering some limitations in classical infrastructures like dedicated clusters, we investigated the viability of cloud infrastructures as a solution.  We found that the installation and operation of LOFAR data calibration pipelines is not only possible, but can also be efficient in cloud infrastructures. The main advantages were: (1) the ease of software installation and maintenance, and the availability of standard APIs and tools, widely used in the industry; this reduces the requirement for significant manual intervention, which can have a highly negative impact in some infrastructures; (2) the flexibility to adapt the infrastructure to the needs of the problem, especially as those demands change over time; (3) the on-demand consumption of (shared) resources. We found that a critical factor (also in other infrastructures) is the availability of scratch storage areas of an appropriate size. We found no significant impediments associated with the speed of data transfer, the use of virtualization, the use of external block storage, or the memory available (provided a minimum threshold is reached).  Finally, we considered the cost-effectiveness of a commercial cloud like Amazon Web Services. While a cloud solution is more expensive than the operation of a large, fully-utilized cluster completely dedicated to LOFAR data reduction, we found that its costs are competitive if the number of datasets to be analysed is not high, or if the costs of maintaining a system capable of calibrating LOFAR data become high. Coupled with the advantages discussed above, this suggests that a cloud infrastructure may be favourable for many users.},

	Volume = 833,
	Year = 2016,
	Abstract = {We present AGNfitter, a publicly available open-source algorithm implementing a fully Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the sub-millimeter to the UV, allowing one to robustly disentangle the physical processes responsible for their emission. AGNfitter makes use of a large library of theoretical, empirical, and semi-empirical models to characterize both the nuclear and host galaxy emission simultaneously. The model consists of four physical emission components: an accretion disk, a torus of AGN heated dust, stellar populations, and cold dust in star-forming regions. AGNfitter determines the posterior distributions of numerous parameters that govern the physics of AGNs with a fully Bayesian treatment of errors and parameter degeneracies, allowing one to infer integrated luminosities, dust attenuation parameters, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We tested AGNfitter's performance on real data by fitting the SEDs of a sample of 714 X-ray selected AGNs from the XMM-COSMOS survey, spectroscopically classified as Type1 (unobscured) and Type2 (obscured) AGNs by their optical-UV emission lines. We find that two independent model parameters, namely the reddening of the accretion disk and the column density of the dusty torus, are good proxies for AGN obscuration, allowing us to develop a strategy for classifying AGNs as Type1 or Type2, based solely on an SED-fitting analysis. Our classification scheme is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic classification, giving a completeness fraction of ˜ 86 %  and ˜ 70 % , and an efficiency of ˜ 80 %  and ˜ 77 % , for Type1 and Type2 AGNs, respectively.},

	Volume = 95,
	Year = 1981,
	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the three-dimensional distribution of light in galactic disks as a first step towards a comprehensive study of the structure of edge-on spiral galaxies. The model has the feature of being isothermal in z at all radii with a scale parameter z0 and has an exponential dependence of surface brightness upon R with a scalelength h. When we apply this model to previously published photometry of NGC 4244 and 5907 (van der Kruit, 1979), edge-on spiral galaxies without an appreciable bulge, we find:  1. To an excellent approximation the scale parameter z0 is independent of R.  2. The radial dependence requires a cut-off at a radius Rmax of a few scale-lengths h.  This cut-off is very sharp with an e-folding less than about 1 kpc. This sets an upper limit of about 10 km s-1 to the radial velocity dispersion in the stars near Rmax.  3. Comparison to the solar neighbourhood shows that we are fitting the self-gravitating intermediate population II and disk population.  This self-gravitating, locally-isothermal, truncated, exponential disk model has a number of interesting features - in particular in connection with finding (1) - which are discussed at the end of the paper. The predicted radial dependence of the velocity dispersion 2z>1/2 upon R is a basic characteristic of these disks, which is in principle open to observational verification.  Application of our model disk to NGC 4565 and subtracting it from the observed surface brightness distribution reveals the light distribution in its prominent bulge and spheroid. In contrast to NGC 4244 and 5907 there is evidence for a "thick disk" in Burstein's (1979c) sense; however we infer from the considerable flattening of the spheroid isophotes with radius that this luminosity is presumably nothing other than the halo population responding to the gravitational field of the disk.},

From this the corrections to the disk surface densities and mass-to-light ratios which are inferred from observed vertical distributions and velocity dispersions of old disk stars and H I are derived. On this basis the best value for the old disk M/L is derived as 6$\pm$2 M_sun;/L_sun;,B. The radial truncation in stellar disks which is observed in edge-on spirals at 4 to 5 exponential scalelengths has also been identified in face-on and moderately inclined disks.},

	Abstract = {The disks of disk galaxies contain a substantial fraction of their baryonic matter and angular momentum, and much of the evolutionary activity in these galaxies, such as the formation of stars, spiral arms, bars and rings, and the various forms of secular evolution, takes place in their disks. The formation and evolution of galactic disks are therefore particularly important for understanding how galaxies form and evolve and the cause of the variety in which they appear to us. Ongoing large surveys, made possible by new instrumentation at wavelengths from the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), via optical (Hubble Space Telescope and large groundbased telescopes) and IR (Spitzer Space Telescope), to the radio are providing much new information about disk galaxies over a wide range of redshift. Although progress has been made, the dynamics and structure of stellar disks, including their truncations, are still not well understood. We do now have plausible estimates of disk mass-to-light ratios, and estimates of Toomre's Q parameter show that they are just locally stable. Disks are mostly very flat and sometimes very thin, and they have a range in surface brightness from canonical disks with a central surface brightness of about 21.5 B-mag arcsec-2 down to very low surface brightnesses. It appears that galaxy disks are not maximal, except possibly in the largest systems. Their Hi layers display warps whenever Hi can be detected beyond the stellar disk, with low-level star formation going on out to large radii. Stellar disks display abundance gradients that flatten at larger radii and sometimes even reverse. The existence of a well-defined baryonic (stellar + Hi) Tully-Fisher relation hints at an approximately uniform baryonic to dark matter ratio. Thick disks are common in disk galaxies, and their existence appears unrelated to the presence of a bulge component; they are old, but their formation is not yet understood. Disk formation was already advanced at redshifts of ˜2, but at that epoch disks were not yet quiescent and in full rotational equilibrium. Downsizing (the gradual reduction with time in the mass of the most actively star-forming galaxies) is now well-established. The formation and history of star formation in S0s are still not fully understood.},

	Abstract = {Neutral hydrogen mapping of 70 dwarf irregular (Sm, Im, and BCD) galaxies is reported, with position-velocity contour maps (and a few contour maps in R.A. and decl.) presented for those resolved by the Arecibo beam. The galaxies were selected either from the Virgo Cluster Catalog, from similarly identified field galaxies, or from a distance- limited sample within the Arecibo declination range. We do not find any isolated dwarfs with a larger H I to optical radius ratio than DDO 154; the "protogalaxy" H I 1225+01 of Giovanelli & Haynes continues to be a unique object among dwarfs that have been mapped in H I. For all dwarfs with significant rotation, we are able to determine the sense of the spin. For a number of better resolved dwarfs, we are able to determine rotation curves, in most cases extending well beyond the last measured point in available synthesis array maps. Correlations among the several measures of galaxy size and mass are studied; in a companion paper we combine these data with those for the set of all available mapped dwarf irregular galaxies and for mapped spirals spanning a similar range of redshifts to investigate variations in Tully-Fisher relations and in surface densities as functions of galaxy size and luminosity or mass.},

	Title = {{Kiloparsec Scale Properties of Star Formation Driven Outflows at z ̃ 2.3 in the SINS/zC-SINF AO Survey}},
	Volume = {873},
	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between star formation activity and outflow properties on kiloparsec scales in a sample of 28 star-forming galaxies at z ̃ 2-2.6, using adaptive optics assisted integral field observations from SINFONI on the Very Large Telescope. The narrow and broad components of the Hα emission are used to simultaneously determine the local star formation rate surface density (   Σ    <SUB>SFR</SUB> ), and the outflow velocity  v <SUB>out</SUB>  and mass outflow rate  \dot M  <SUB>out</SUB> , respectively. We find clear evidence for faster outflows with larger mass loading factors at higher    Σ    <SUB>SFR</SUB> . The outflow velocities scale as  v <SUB>out</SUB>  ∝    Σ    <SUB>SFR</SUB>  <SUP>0.34$\pm$0.10</SUP>, which suggests that the outflows may be driven by a combination of mechanical energy released by supernova explosions and stellar winds, as well as radiation pressure acting on dust grains. The majority of the outflowing material does not have sufficient velocity to escape from the galaxy halos, but will likely be re-accreted and contribute to the chemical enrichment of the galaxies. In the highest    Σ    <SUB>SFR</SUB>  regions the outflow component contains an average of ̃45% of the Hα flux, while in the lower    Σ    <SUB>SFR</SUB>  regions only ̃10% of the Hα flux is associated with outflows.

	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {We present the $0.6&lt;z&lt;2.6$ evolution of the ionized gas velocity dispersion in 175 star-forming disk galaxies based on data from the full KMOS$^ \rm 3D $ integral field spectroscopic survey. In a forward-modelling Bayesian framework including instrumental effects and beam-smearing, we fit simultaneously the observed galaxy velocity and velocity dispersion along the kinematic major axis to derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$. We find a reduction of the average intrinsic velocity dispersion of disk galaxies as a function of cosmic time, from $\sigma_0\sim45$ km s$^ -1 $ at $z\sim2.3$ to $\sigma_0\sim30$ km s$^ -1 $ at $z\sim0.9$. There is substantial intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_ \sigma_0,  \rm int  \approx10$ km s$^ -1 $) around the best-fit $\sigma_0-z$-relation beyond what can be accounted for from the typical measurement uncertainties ($\delta\sigma_0\approx12$ km s$^ -1 $), independent of other identifiable galaxy parameters. This potentially suggests a dynamic mechanism such as minor mergers or variation in accretion being responsible for the scatter. Putting our data into the broader literature context, we find that ionized and atomic+molecular velocity dispersions evolve similarly with redshift, with the ionized gas dispersion being $\sim10-15$ km s$^ -1 $ higher on average. We investigate the physical driver of the on average elevated velocity dispersions at higher redshift, and find that our galaxies are at most marginally Toomre-stable, suggesting that their turbulent velocities are powered by gravitational instabilities, while stellar feedback as a driver alone is insufficient. This picture is supported through comparison with a state-of-the-art analytical model of galaxy evolution.},

	Title = {{Three Dimensional Optimal Spectral Extraction (TDOSE) from Integral Field Spectroscopy}},
	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {[Abbreviated] The amount of integral field spectrograph (IFS) data has grown considerable over the last few decades. The demand for tools to analyze such data is therefore bigger now than ever. We present TDOSE; a flexible Python tool for Three Dimensional Optimal Spectral Extraction from IFS data cubes. TDOSE works on any three-dimensional data cube and bases the spectral extractions on morphological reference image models. In each wavelength layer of the IFS data cube, TDOSE simultaneously optimizes all sources in the morphological model to minimize the difference between the scaled model components and the IFS data. The flux optimization produces individual data cubes containing the scaled three-dimensional source models. This allows for efficient de-blending of flux in both the spatial and spectral dimensions of the IFS data cubes, and extraction of the corresponding one-dimensional spectra. We present an example of how the three-dimensional source models generated by TDOSE can be used to improve two-dimensional maps of physical parameters. By extracting TDOSE spectra of $\sim$150 [OII] emitters from the MUSE-Wide survey we show that the median increase in line flux is $\sim$5% when using multi-component models as opposed to single-component models. However, the increase in recovered line emission in individual cases can be as much as 50%. Comparing the TDOSE model-based extractions of the MUSE-Wide [OII] emitters with aperture spectra, the TDOSE spectra provides a median flux (S/N) increase of 9% (14%). Hence, TDOSE spectra optimizes the S/N while still being able to recover the total emitted flux. TDOSE version 3.0 presented in this paper is available at https://github.com/kasperschmidt/TDOSE.},

	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(J = 2 - 1) observations of two main-sequence star-forming galaxies at z ̃ 1.47 taken from the High-Z Emission Line Survey (HiZELS). These two systems have been previously reported to be molecular gas rich f_H_2 ≡ M_H_2/(M_H_2 + M_\star ) ̃ 0.8. We carried out a follow-up study to resolve, at ̃kpc-scales, the CO emission. These new observations are combined with our earlier ALMA observations (sensitive to diffuse CO emission) and compared with our previous Hα-based study at matched spatial resolution. One target is marginally resolved in CO(2-1), showing complex dynamics with respect to the ionised gas traced by Hα. While the other source is spatially resolved, enabling a detailed exploration of its internal dynamical properties. In this system, both gaseous phases show similar spatial extension, rotation velocities and velocity dispersions (V<SUB>rot</SUB> ̃ σ<SUB>v</SUB> ̃ 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) suggesting a rotational velocity to velocity dispersion ratio consistent with unity. By comparing the ionized and molecular gas tracers through the use of a two-dimensional kinematic model, we estimate a median depletion time τ<SUB>dep</SUB> = 2.3 $\pm$ 1.2 Gyr for the galaxy as a whole. This value is in agreement with the average τ<SUB>dep</SUB> value observed in local star-forming galaxies at similar spatial scales. Using a thick-disk dynamical modelling, we derive a dynamical mass M<SUB>dyn</SUB> = (1.59 $\pm$ 0.19) × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> within ≈6 kpc. This suggests a dark matter fraction (f<SUB>DM</SUB> ≡ M<SUB>DM</SUB>/M<SUB>dyn</SUB> of 0.59 $\pm$ 0.10, in agreement with the average f<SUB>DM</SUB> value derived from stacked rotation curve analysis of galaxies at similar redshift range.},

	Title = {{A Precision Measurement of the Mass of the Black Hole in NGC 3258 from High-Resolution ALMA Observations of its Circumnuclear Disk}},
	Year = {2019},
	Abstract = {We present $\sim0.10^ \prime\prime -$resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2$-$1) imaging of the arcsecond-scale ($r \approx 150$ pc) dusty molecular disk in the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 3258. The data provide unprecedented resolution of cold gas disk kinematics within the dynamical sphere of influence of a supermassive black hole, revealing a quasi-Keplerian central increase in projected rotation speed rising from 280 km s$^ -1 $ at the disk's outer edge to $>400$ km s$^ -1 $ near the disk center. We construct dynamical models for the rotating disk and fit beam-smeared model CO line profiles directly to the ALMA data cube. Our models incorporate both flat disks and tilted-ring disks that provide a better fit of the mildly warped structure in NGC 3258. We show that the exceptional angular resolution of the ALMA data makes it possible to infer the host galaxy's mass profile within $r=150$ pc solely from the ALMA CO kinematics, without relying on optical or near-infrared imaging data to determine the stellar mass profile. Our model therefore circumvents any uncertainty in the black hole mass that would result from the substantial dust extinction in the galaxy's central region. The best model fit yields $M_\mathrm BH  = 2.249\times10^9$ $M_\odot$ with a statistical model-fitting uncertainty of just 0.18\%, and systematic uncertainties of 0.62\% from various aspects of the model construction and 12\% from uncertainty in the distance to NGC 3258. This observation demonstrates the full potential of ALMA for carrying out highly precise measurements of $M_\mathrm BH $ in early-type galaxies containing circumnuclear gas disks},

	Title = {{How Well Can We Measure the Intrinsic Velocity Dispersion of Distant Disk Galaxies?}},
	Volume = {741},
	Year = {2011},
	Abstract = {The kinematics of distant galaxies from z = 0.1 to z &gt; 2 play a key role in our understanding of galaxy evolution from early times to the present. One of the important parameters is the intrinsic, or local, velocity dispersion of a galaxy, which allows one to quantify the degree of non-circular motions such as pressure support. However, this is difficult to measure because the observed dispersion includes the effects of (often severe) beam smearing on the velocity gradient. Here we investigate four methods of measuring the dispersion that have been used in the literature, to assess their effectiveness at recovering the intrinsic dispersion. We discuss the biases inherent in each method, and apply them to model disk galaxies in order to determine which methods yield meaningful quantities and under what conditions. All the mean-weighted dispersion estimators are affected by (residual) beam smearing. In contrast, the dispersion recovered by fitting a spatially and spectrally convolved disk model to the data is unbiased by the beam smearing it is trying to compensate. Because of this, and because the bias it does exhibit depends only on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), it can be considered reliable. However, at very low S/N, all methods should be used with caution.},

	Title = {{Infrared Spectral Energy Distribution Decomposition of WISE-selected, Hyperluminous Hot Dust-obscured Galaxies}},
	Volume = {823},
	Year = {2016},
	Abstract = {We utilize a Bayesian approach to fit the observed mid-IR-to-submillimeter/millimeter spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 22 WISE-selected and submillimeter-detected, hyperluminous hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), with spectroscopic redshift ranging from 1.7 to 4.6. We compare the Bayesian evidence of a torus plusgraybody (Torus+GB) model with that of a torus-only (Torus) model and find that the Torus+GB model has higher Bayesian evidence for all 22 Hot DOGs than the torus-only model, which presents strong evidence in favor of the Torus+GB model. By adopting the Torus+GB model, we decompose the observed IR SEDs of Hot DOGs into torus and cold dust components. The main results are as follows. (1) Hot DOGs in our submillimeter-detected sample are hyperluminous ( L <SUB> IR</SUB> ≥slant  10 <SUP>13</SUP> L <SUB>☉ </SUB>), with torus emission dominating the IR energy output. However, cold dust emission is non-negligible, contributing on average ̃ 24% of total IR luminosity. (2) Compared to QSO and starburst SED templates, the median SED of Hot DOGs shows the highest luminosity ratio between mid-IR and submillimeter at rest frame, while it is very similar to that of QSOs at ̃ 10 -- 50 μ   m  , suggesting that the heating sources of Hot DOGs should be buried AGNs. (3) Hot DOGs have high dust temperatures ( T <SUB> dust</SUB> ̃ 72 K) and high IR luminosity of cold dust. The  T <SUB> dust</SUB>  --  L <SUB> IR</SUB>  relation of Hot DOGs suggests that the increase in IR luminosity for Hot DOGs is mostly due to the increase of the dust temperature, rather than dust mass. Hot DOGs have lower dust masses than submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and QSOs within a similar redshift range. Both high IR luminosity of cold dust and relatively low dust mass in Hot DOGs can be expected by their relatively high dust temperatures. (4) Hot DOGs have high dust-covering factors (CFs), which deviate from the previously proposed trend of the dust CF decreasing with increasing bolometric luminosity. Finally, we can reproduce the observed properties in Hot DOGs by employing a physical model of galaxy evolution. This result suggests that Hot DOGs may lie at or close to peaks of both star formation and black hole growth histories, and represent a transit phase during the evolutions of massive galaxies, transforming them from the dusty starburst-dominated phase to the optically bright QSO phase.},
