Design Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ flexible and expandable modeling algorithm implementation
+ provide various parameter optimization choices and robust error estimations
+ the comparison can be made in either image and visibility domain
+ handle multiple images/cubes simultaneously and treat blended line/objects together
+ straightforward parameter setting: the emission model was built upon parameters describing "physical" properties of each object; the emission models can be easiliy translated into the data obatined in radio (frequency) or optical (wavelength) with pre-defined system response functions
+ provide data/model visulizations (xy/pv-moms) and clear diagnostic plots for parameter fitting goodness (chi^2/posterior-prob)
