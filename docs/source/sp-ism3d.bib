	Volume = {149},
	Year = 2003,
	Abstract = {This compilation revises the 1991 listing of atomic data for the lighter elements from hydrogen to gallium. The tabulation emphasizes resonance lines, i.e., lines whose lower level is the ground state, or an excited fine-structure state of the ground term, and is restricted to wavelengths longward of the H I Lyman limit at 911.753 {\AA}. All but the very weakest known and predicted electric-dipole transitions are included, but no forbidden lines. This paper has attempted to review all data published by the end of 2002. <P />The tables contain the best data available to the author on ionization potentials, level designations, vacuum and air wavelengths, lower and upper energy levels, statistical weights, transition probabilities, natural damping constants (reciprocal lifetimes), oscillator strengths, and the often used combinations of loggf and logλf. All ion stages with relevant classified lines are included. Individual components resulting from isotope shift and hyperfine structure are listed explicitly for certain species. The accompanying text provides references, explanations for the critical selection of data, and notes indicating where new measurements or calculations are needed. <P />This compilation should be particularly useful in the analysis of interstellar and quasar absorption lines and other astrophysical sites where the density of particles and radiation is low enough to excite only the lowest atomic levels. The data also are relevant to the study of stellar atmospheres, and gaseous nebulae. <P />An Appendix summarizes new data relevant to the similar compilation in Paper II for the elements germanium to uranium.},

	Title = {{A parallel non-uniform fast Fourier transform library based on an ``exponential of semicircle'' kernel}},
	Year = 2018,
	Abstract = {The nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) generalizes the FFT to off-grid data. Its many applications include image reconstruction, data analysis, and the numerical solution of differential equations. We present FINUFFT, an efficient parallel library for type 1 (nonuiform to uniform), type 2 (uniform to nonuniform), or type 3 (nonuniform to nonuniform) transforms, in dimensions 1, 2, or 3. It uses minimal RAM, requires no precomputation or plan steps, and has a simple interface to several languages. We perform the expensive spreading/interpolation between nonuniform points and the fine grid via a simple new kernel---the `exponential of semicircle' $e^ \beta \sqrt 1-x^2  $ in $x\in[-1,1]$---in a cache-aware load-balanced multithreaded implementation. The deconvolution step requires the Fourier transform of the kernel, for which we propose efficient numerical quadrature. For types 1 and 2, rigorous error bounds asymptotic in the kernel width approach the fastest known exponential rate, namely that of the Kaiser--Bessel kernel. We benchmark against several popular CPU-based libraries, showing favorable speed and memory footprint, especially in three dimensions when high accuracy and/or clustered point distributions are desired. <P />},

	Abstract = {Large galaxy surveys have demonstrated that galaxy-galaxy mergers can dramatically change the morphologies, star formation rates (SFRs), and metallicities of their constituents. However, most statistical studies have been limited to the measurement of global quantities, through large fibres or integrated colours. In this work, we present the first statistically significant study of spatially resolved star formation and metallicity profiles using integral field spectroscopy, using a sample of ∼20 000 spaxels in 36 visually selected post-merger galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey. By measuring offsets from SFR and metallicity scaling relations on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis, we are able to quantify where in the galaxy these properties are most affected by the interaction. We find that the SFR enhancements are generally centrally peaked, by a factor of 2.5 on average, in agreement with predictions from simulations. However, there is considerable variation in the SFR behaviour in the galactic outskirts, where both enhancement and suppression are seen. The median SFR remains enhanced by 0.1 dex out to at least 1.9 R<SUB>e</SUB>. The metallicity is also affected out to these large radii, typically showing a suppression of ∼-0.04 dex.},

	Volume = {882},
	Year = 2019,
	Abstract = {The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) SPECtroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) is an ALMA large program that obtained a frequency scan in the 3 mm band to detect emission lines from the molecular gas in distant galaxies. Here we present our search strategy for emission lines and continuum sources in the HUDF. We compare several line search algorithms used in the literature, and critically account for the line widths of the emission line candidates when assessing significance. We identify 16 emission lines at high fidelity in our search. Comparing these sources to multiwavelength data we find that all sources have optical/infrared counterparts. Our search also recovers candidates of lower significance that can be used statistically to derive, e.g., the CO luminosity function. We apply the same detection algorithm to obtain a sample of six 3 mm continuum sources. All of these are also detected in the 1.2 mm continuum with optical/near-infrared counterparts. We use the continuum sources to compute 3 mm number counts in the sub-millijansky regime, and find them to be higher by an order of magnitude than expected for synchrotron-dominated sources. However, the number counts are consistent with those derived at shorter wavelengths (0.85-1.3 mm) once extrapolating to 3 mm with a dust emissivity index of β = 1.5, dust temperature of 35 K, and an average redshift of z = 2.5. These results represent the best constraints to date on the faint end of the 3 mm number counts.},
