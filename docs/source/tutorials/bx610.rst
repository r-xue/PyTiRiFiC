Bx610: Visibility-based Modeling of its line/continuum covered in two ALMA bands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* high-z object
* 40&50hrs on-source observation
* marginally resolved
* joint fitting of mutiple ALMA observations in two bands (BAND A and B)
* simutouse modelling of all line (CO4-3/CI1-0 & CO7-6/CI2-1) and continuum emission under the same galaxy kinmetics assumption.
