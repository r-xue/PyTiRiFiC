GMaKE is inspired by several well-developed open-source packages, which are usually designed for specific user cases and data types, or provide some equivalent module functions/algorithms within GMaKE.
We greatly appreciate their open-source knowledge sharing efforts, and list them here as important reference for the general topics here with a short description.
offer a subset of GMaKE's capabilities or serve as a backbone of some specific usage cases (i.a)
Some package offering some similar functions or moldeing capacibilt with what GMaKE offer, although they are mostly specified for specific data form or optimized for 
some user case covered by GMaKE. We list them here as reference for this general topic here:

- `galmod <https://www.astro.rug.nl/~gipsy/tsk/galmod.dc1>`_

	Likely the first popular implementation of the tiled-ring algorithm
	
- `Bbarolo <https://editeodoro.github.io/Bbarolo/>`_

	Improve upon the tiled-ring algorithm from galmod, with full model fitting features (likely for a single-line/disk user case)

- `KinMS <https://github.com/TimothyADavis/KinMSpy>`_

	another Python and IDL implantation of tilet-ring model method to simulate spectral-cube from a rotating disk galaxy 

- `TiRiFiC <http://gigjozsa.github.io/tirific>`_

	a fortran-based spectral line models with full fitting function
	
- `GALFIT <https://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html>`_

	 widely used 2D images from more sophisticated galaxy morphology functions
	 
- `galario <https://github.com/mtazzari/galario>`_

	a C-based package wiich can transfer model images to visibilities for UV-based fitting (see note here)

- `UVMULTIFIT <UVMULTIFIT>`_

	a packge for, required instatltion into a stand-alone Python package

- `PDSPY <https://github.com/psheehan/pdspy:>`_

- `EHT-imaging <https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging>`_

- `smili <https://github.com/astrosmili/smili>`_

- `NFFT <https://github.com/NFFT/nfft>`_

	a packge for, required instatltion into a stand-alone Python package

- `GalSim <https://github.com/GalSim-developers>`_

- `lenstronomy <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions>`_
